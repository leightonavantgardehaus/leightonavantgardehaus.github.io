# COMPOSITE CARD — IQX-Astraeus (Dynamic Operations Intelligence Engine)

## 1. Overview
- **Model Name:** IQX-Astraeus 
- **Version:** 1.8.2  
- **Owner:** Leighton Dynamica — Intelligent Systems Division  
- **Intended Use:**  
  Provide real‑time operational intelligence, anomaly detection, and decision‑support insights for enterprise and healthcare environments.  
- **Not Intended For:**  
  Autonomous decision‑making without human oversight; clinical diagnosis; legal or financial determinations.

## 2. System Context
- **Operational Environment:**  
  Deployed within the Dynamic Intelligence Platform (DIP), integrated with enterprise data pipelines and healthcare operational systems.  
- **Dependencies:**  
  Secure data ingestion layer, internal feature store, explainability engine, monitoring subsystem.  
- **Human-in-the-loop Requirements:**  
  Required for all high‑impact decisions; override mechanisms available at all times.

## 3. Training Data
- **Data Sources:**  
  - Operational logs  
  - Workflow metadata  
  - De‑identified healthcare operational data  
  - Historical performance metrics  
- **Data Characteristics:**  
  Mixed structured/unstructured; time‑series heavy; multi‑domain.  
- **Known Limitations:**  
  Limited representation of rare operational edge cases; dependent on data quality from client systems.  
- **Data Governance Notes:**  
  All healthcare‑related data is de‑identified and processed under strict compliance protocols.

## 4. Performance
- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - Precision/Recall for anomaly detection  
  - Latency for real‑time inference  
  - Stability under load  
- **Benchmark Results:**  
  - 94% anomaly detection precision  
  - 87% recall  
  - <120ms inference latency under peak load  
- **Stress Test Results:**  
  Stable up to 4× expected throughput.  
- **Edge-case Behavior:**  
  Falls back to conservative alerts when confidence drops below threshold.

## 5. Explainability
- **Explanation Methods Used:**  
  - SHAP‑based feature attribution  
  - Decision pathway tracing  
  - Confidence scoring  
- **User-facing Explanation Modes:**  
  - Executive summaries  
  - Operator‑level causal factors  
  - Technical deep‑dive visualizations  
- **Confidence Indicators:**  
  Provided for every prediction and recommendation.

## 6. Ethical & Risk Considerations
- **Bias Evaluation:**  
  Regular audits for domain‑specific bias (e.g., operational load distribution).  
- **Mitigation Strategies:**  
  Balanced sampling; fairness constraints; human‑in‑the‑loop checkpoints.  
- **Potential Harms:**  
  Misinterpretation of alerts; over‑reliance on automated insights.  
- **Safeguards:**  
  Mandatory human review for high‑impact outputs; clear uncertainty indicators.

## 7. Security
- **Threat Model:**  
  Protect against data poisoning, model extraction, unauthorized access.  
- **Access Controls:**  
  Role‑based access; multi‑factor authentication; encrypted endpoints.  
- **Logging & Auditability:**  
  Immutable logs; versioned inference records.

## 8. Monitoring & Maintenance
- **Drift Detection:**  
  Automated drift alerts; monthly drift reports.  
- **Retraining Schedule:**  
  Quarterly or as triggered by drift thresholds.  
- **Incident Response Process:**  
  24‑hour review window; rollback to previous model version if needed.

## 9. Version History
- **Changes in This Version:**  
  Improved anomaly detection recall; enhanced explainability engine.  
- **Previous Versions:**  
  1.7.2, 1.7.1, 1.6.9, 1.6.3
