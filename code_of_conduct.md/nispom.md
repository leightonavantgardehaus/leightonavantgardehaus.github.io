§ 117.2 Applicability.
(a) This rule applies to:

(1) The Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Military Departments, the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Joint Staff, the Combatant Commands, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Defense, the Defense Agencies, the DoD Field Activities, and all other organizational entities within the DoD (referred to collectively in this rule as the “DoD Components”).

(2) All executive branch departments and agencies.

(3) All industrial, educational, commercial, or other non-USG entities granted access to classified information by the USG executive branch departments and agencies or by foreign governments.

(4) The release of classified information by the USG to contractors, who are required to safeguard classified information released during all phases of the contracting, agreement (including cooperative research and development agreements), licensing, and grant processes, i.e., the preparation and submission of bids and proposals, negotiation, award, performance, and termination. Also, it applies in situations involving a contract, agreement, license, or grant when actual knowledge of classified information is not required, but reasonable physical security measures cannot be employed to prevent aural or visual access to classified information, because there is the ability and opportunity to gain knowledge of classified information. It also applies to any other situation in which classified information or FGI that is furnished to a contractor requires protection in the interest of national security, but which is not released under a contract, license, certificate or grant.

(b) This rule does not:

(1) Limit in any manner the authority of USG executive branch departments and agencies to grant access to classified information under the cognizance of their department or agency to any individual designated by them. The granting of such access is outside the scope of the NISP and is accomplished pursuant to E.O. 12968, E.O. 13526, E.O. 13691, the AEA, and applicable disclosure policies.

(2) Apply to criminal proceedings in the courts or authorize contractors or their employees to disclose classified information in connection with any criminal proceedings. Defendants and their representative in criminal proceedings in U.S. District Courts, Courts of Appeal, and the U.S. Supreme Court may gain access to classified information in accordance with 18 U.S.C. Appendix 3, Section 1, also known as and referred to in this rule as the “Classified Information Procedures Act,” as amended.

The carrier providing the service must maintain a signature and tally record for the shipment.

Consultant means an individual under contract, and compensated directly, to provide professional or technical assistance to a contractor in a capacity requiring access to classified information.

Continuous evaluation as defined in SEAD 6 is a personnel security investigative process to review the background of a covered individual who has been determined to be eligible for access to classified information or to hold a sensitive position at any time during the period of eligibility. Continuous evaluation leverages a set of automated records checks and business rules, to assist in the ongoing assessment of an individual's continued eligibility. It supplements, but does not replace, the established personnel security program for scheduled periodic reinvestigations of individuals for continuing eligibility.

Continuous monitoring program means a system that facilitates ongoing awareness of threats, vulnerabilities, and information security to support organizational risk management decisions.

Contracting officer means a USG official who, in accordance with departmental or agency procedures, has the authority to enter into and administer contracts, licenses or grants and make determinations and findings with respect thereto, or any part of such authority. The term also includes the designated representative of the contracting officer acting within the limits of his or her authority.

Contractor means any industrial, educational, commercial, or other entity that has been granted an entity eligibility determination by a CSA.

Cyber incident means actions taken through the use of computer networks that result in an actual or potentially adverse effect on an information system or the information residing therein.

Declassification means a date or event which coincides with the lapse of the information's national security sensitivity, as determined by the OCA. Declassification occurs when the OCA has determined that the classified information no longer requires, in the interest of national security, any degree of protection against unauthorized disclosure, and the information has had its classification designation removed or cancelled.

Defense articles means those articles, services, and related technical data, including software, in tangible or intangible form, which are listed on the United States Munitions List (USML) of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), as modified or amended. Defense articles exempt from the scope of ITAR section 126.17 are identified in Supplement No. 1 to Part 126 of the ITAR.

It may reference an entire organization, a prime contractor, parent organization, a branch or division, another type of sub-element, a sub-contractor, subsidiary, or other subordinate or connected entity (referred to as “sub-entities” when necessary to distinguish such entities from prime or parent entities). It may also reference a specific location or facility, or the headquarters or official business location of the organization, depending upon the organization's business structure, the access needs involved, and the responsible CSA's procedures. The term “entity” as used in this rule refers to the particular entity to which an agency might release, or is releasing, classified information, whether that entity is a parent or subordinate organization. The term “entity” in this rule includes contractors.

Entity eligibility determination means an assessment by the CSA as to whether an entity is eligible for access to classified information of a certain level (and all lower levels). Entity eligibility determinations may be broad or limited to specific contracts, sponsoring agencies, or circumstances. A favorable entity eligibility determination results in eligibility to access classified information under the cognizance of the responsible CSA to the level approved. When the entity would be accessing categories of information such as RD or SCI for which the CSA for that information has set additional requirements, CSAs must also assess whether the entity is eligible for access to that category of information. Some CSAs refer to their favorable entity eligibility determinations as FCLs. However, a favorable entity eligibility determination for the DHS CCIPP is not equivalent to an FCL and does not meet the requirements for FCL reciprocity. A favorable entity eligibility determination does not convey authority to store classified information.

Escort means a cleared person, designated by the contractor, who accompanies a shipment of classified material to its destination. The classified material does not remain in the personal possession of the escort but the conveyance in which the material is transported remains under the constant observation and control of the escort.

FCL means an administrative determination that, from a security viewpoint, an entity is eligible for access to classified information of a certain level (and all lower levels) (e.g., a type of favorable entity eligibility determination used by some CSAs). An entity eligibility determination for the DHS CCIPP is not the equivalent of an FCL and does not meet the requirements for FCL reciprocity.

FGI means information that is:

(1) Provided to the United States by a foreign government or governments, an international organization of governments, or any element thereof with the expectation, expressed or implied, that the information, the source of the information, or both, are to be held in confidence; or

(2) Produced by the United States pursuant to, or as a result of, a joint arrangement with a foreign government or governments, an international organization of governments, or any element thereof, requiring that the information, the arrangement, or both are to be held in confidence.

Throughout this rule, the term grant will include both the grant and cooperative agreement.

Grantee means the entity that receives a grant or cooperative agreement.

Hand carrier means a cleared employee, designated by the contractor, who occasionally hand carries classified material to its destination in connection with a classified visit or meeting. The classified material remains in the personal possession of the hand carrier except for authorized overnight storage.

L access authorization means an access determination that is granted by DOE or NRC based on a Tier 3 or successor background investigation as set forth in applicable national-level requirements and DOE directives. Within DOE and NRC, an “L” access authorization permits an individual who has an official “need to know” to access Confidential Restricted Data, Secret and Confidential Formerly Restricted Data, Secret and Confidential Transclassified Foreign Nuclear Information, or Secret and Confidential National Security Information, required in the performance of official duties. An “L” access authorization determination is required for individuals with a need to know outside of DOE, NRC, DoD, and in limited cases NASA, to access Confidential Restricted Data.

At a minimum, cooperation includes:

(1) Providing suitable arrangements within the facility for conducting private interviews with employees during normal working hours;

(2) Providing, when requested, relevant employment or personnel files, security records, supervisory files, records pertinent to insider threat (e.g., security, cybersecurity, and human resources) and any other records pertaining to an individual under investigation that are, in the possession or control of the contractor or the contractor's representatives or located in the contractor's offices;

(3) Providing access to employment and security records that are located at an offsite location; and

(4) Rendering other necessary assistance.

(g) Security training and briefings. Contractors will advise all cleared employees, including those assigned to USG locations or operations outside the United States, of their individual responsibility for classification management and for safeguarding classified information. Contractors will provide security training to cleared employees consisting of initial briefings, refresher briefings, and debriefings in accordance with § 117.12.

(h) Security reviews —

(1) USG reviews. The applicable CSA will conduct recurring oversight reviews of contractors' NISP security programs to verify that the contractor is protecting classified information and implementing the provisions of this rule. The contractor's participation in the security review is required for maintaining the entity's eligibility for access to classified information.

(i) Review cycle. The CSA will determine the scope and frequency of security reviews, which may be increased or decreased consistent with risk management principles.

(ii) Procedures. (A) The CSA will generally provide notice to the contractor of a forthcoming review, but may also conduct unannounced reviews at its discretion. The CSA security review may subject contractor employees and all areas and receptacles under the control of the contractor to examination.

(B) The CSA will make every effort to avoid unnecessary intrusion into the personal effects of contractor personnel.

(C) The CSA may conduct physical examinations of the interior space of containers not authorized to secure classified material. Such examinations will always be accomplished in the presence of a representative of the contractor.

(iii) Controlled unclassified information (CUI). 32 CFR part 2002 requires agencies to implement CUI requirements, but compliance with CUI requirements is outside the scope of the NISP and this rule. However, CSAs may conduct CUI assessments in conjunction with NISP USG reviews when:

(A) The contractor is a participant in the NISP based on a requirement to access classified information;

(B) A classified contract under the CSA's cognizance includes provisions for access to, or protection or handling of, CUI; and

(C) The CSA has provided the contractor with specific guidance regarding the assessment criteria and methodology it will use for overseeing protection of the CUI being accessed, stored or transmitted by the contractor as part of the classified contract.

(2) Contractor reviews. Contractors will review their security programs on a continuing basis and conduct a formal self-inspection at least annually and at intervals consistent with risk management principles.

(i) Self-inspections will include the review of the classified activity, classified information, classified information systems, conditions of the overall security program, and the insider threat program. They will have sufficient scope, depth, and frequency, and will have management support during the self-inspection and during remedial actions taken as a result of the self-inspection. Self-inspections will include the review of samples representing the contractor's derivative classification actions, as applicable.

(ii) The contractor will prepare a formal report describing the self-inspection, its findings, and its resolution of issues discovered during the self-inspection. The contractor will retain the formal report for CSA review until after the next CSA security review is completed.

(iii) The SMO at the cleared facility will annually certify to the CSA, in writing, that a self-inspection has been conducted, that other KMP have been briefed on the results of the self-inspection, that appropriate corrective actions have been taken, and that management fully supports the security program at the cleared facility in the manner as described in the certification.

(i) Contractors working at USG locations. Contractor employees performing work within the confines of a USG facility will safeguard classified information according to the procedures of the host installation or agency.

(j) Hotlines. Federal agencies maintain hotlines to provide an unconstrained avenue for USG and contractor employees to report, without fear of reprisal, known or suspected instances of security irregularities and infractions concerning contracts, programs, or projects. These hotlines do not supplant the contractor's responsibility to facilitate reporting and timely investigations of security issues concerning its operations or personnel. Contractor personnel are encouraged to report information through established contractor channels. The hotline may be used as an alternate means to report this type of information. Contractors will inform all personnel that hotlines may be used for reporting issues of national security significance. Each CSA will post hotline information and telephone numbers on their websites for contractor access.

(k) Agency agreements. 32 CFR part 2004 and E.O. 12829 require non-CSA agency heads to enter into agreements with the Secretary of Defense as the Executive Agent for the NISP to provide industrial security services. The Secretary of Defense may also enter into agreements to provide services for other CSA's in accordance with 32 CFR part 2004 and E.O. 12829. Agency agreements establish the terms of the Secretary of Defense's (or the Secretary of Defense's designee's) responsibilities when acting as the CSA on behalf of these agency heads. The list of agencies for which the Secretary of Defense has agreed to render industrial security services is on the DCSA website at https://www.dcsa.mil.

(l) Security cognizance. The CSA will inform contractors if oversight has been delegated to a CSO.

(m) Rule interpretations. Contractors will forward requests for interpretations of this rule to their CSA in accordance with their CSA-provided guidance to supplement unique CSA mission requirements.

(n) Waivers to this rule. Contractors will submit any requests to waive provisions of this rule in accordance with CSA procedures, which may include periodic review of approved waivers. When submitting a request for a waiver, the contractor will, in writing, explain why it is impractical or unreasonable for the contractor to comply with the requirement it is asking to waive, identify alternative measures as prescribed by this rule, and include a proposed duration for the waiver. The contractor cannot implement a waiver unless the waiver is approved by the applicable CSA.

(o) Complaints and suggestions. Contractors may forward NISP administration complaints and suggestions to the Director of ISOO. However, contractors are encouraged to forward NISP administration complaints and suggestions to their respective CSA prior to forwarding to the ISOO.

§ 117.8 Reporting requirements.
(a) General. Pursuant to this rule, Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 3, (available at: https://www.dni.gov/files/NCSC/documents/Regulations/SEAD-3-Reporting-U.pdf) and CSA-provided guidance to supplement unique CSA mission requirements, contractors and their cleared employees are required to:

(1) Report certain events that may have an effect on the status of the entity's or an employee's eligibility for access to classified information; report events that indicate an insider threat to classified information or to employees with access to classified information; report events that affect proper safeguarding of classified information; and report events that indicate classified information has been, or is suspected to be, lost or compromised.

(2) Establish internal procedures to ensure employees with eligibility for access to classified information are aware of their responsibilities for reporting pertinent information to the FSO. The contractor will:

(i) Provide reports to the FBI, or other Federal authorities as required by this rule, the terms of a classified contract or other agreement, and by U.S. law.

(ii) Provide complete information to enable the CSA to ascertain whether classified information is adequately protected.

(iii) Submit reports to the FBI, the CSA, or the ISOO as specified in paragraphs (b), (c), and (g) of this section.

(3) Appropriately mark reports containing classified information in accordance with § 117.14.

(4) Clearly mark a report containing information submitted in confidence as containing that information. When reports contain information pertaining to an individual, 5 U.S.C. 552a (also known as and referred to in this rule as “The Privacy Act of 1974, as amended,”) permits the withholding of certain information from the individual in accordance with specific exemptions, which include authority to withhold release of information to the extent that the disclosure of the information would reveal the identity of a source who furnished the information to the USG under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence.

(b) Reports to be submitted to the FBI. The contractor will promptly submit a written report to the nearest field office of the FBI regarding information coming to the contractor's attention concerning actual, probable, or possible espionage, sabotage, terrorism, or subversive activities at any of its locations.

(1) An initial report may be made by phone, but it must be followed up in writing (e.g., email or formal correspondence), regardless of the FBI's disposition of the report.

(2) The contractor will promptly notify the CSA when they make a report to the FBI and provide the CSA a copy of the written report.

(c) Reports to be submitted to the CSA —

(1) Adverse information. Contractors are required to report adverse information coming to their attention concerning any of their employees determined to be eligible for access to classified information, in accordance with this rule, SEAD 3, and CSA-provided guidance. Contractors will not make reports based on rumor or innuendo.

(i) The termination of employment of an employee does not negate the requirement to submit this report. If a contractor employee is assigned to a USG location, the contractor will furnish a copy of the report and its final disposition to the USG security point of contact for that location.

(ii) Pursuant to Becker v. Philco, 372 F.2d 771 (4th Cir. 1967), cert. denied 389 U.S. 979 (1967), and subsequent cases, a contractor may not be liable for defamation of an employee because of communications that are required of and made by a contractor to an agency of the United States under the requirements of this rule or under the terms of applicable contracts.

(2) Suspicious contacts. Contractors will report information pertaining to suspicious contacts with employees determined to be eligible for access to classified information, and pertaining to efforts to obtain illegal or unauthorized access to the contractor's cleared facility by any means, including:

(i) Efforts by any individual, regardless of nationality, to obtain illegal or unauthorized access to classified information.

(ii) Efforts by any individual, regardless of nationality, to elicit information from an employee determined eligible for access to classified information, and any contact which suggests the employee may be the target of an attempted exploitation by an intelligence service of another country. See SEAD 3 for specific information to be reported.

(3) Change in status of employees determined eligible for access to classified information. Contractors will report by means of the CSA-designated reporting mechanism information pertaining to changes in status of employees determined eligible for access to classified information such as:

(i) Death.

(ii) Change in name.

(iii) Termination of employment.

(iv) Change in citizenship.

(4) Citizenship by naturalization. Contractors will report if a non-U.S. citizen employee granted an LAA becomes a citizen through naturalization. The report will include:

(i) City, county, and state where naturalized.

(ii) Date naturalized.

(iii) Court.

(iv) Certificate number.

(5) Employees desiring not to be processed for a national security eligibility determination or not to perform classified work. Contractors will report instances when an employee no longer wishes to be processed for a determination of eligibility for access to classified information or to continue having access to classified information, and the reason for that request.

(6) Classified information nondisclosure agreement (NDA). Contractors will report the refusal by an employee to sign the SF 312, “Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement,” (available at: https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/SF312-13.pdf?forceDownload=1) or other approved NDA.

(7) Changed conditions affecting the contractor's eligibility for access to classified information. Contractors are required to report certain events that affect the status of the entity eligibility determination (e.g., FCL), affect the status of an employee's PCL, may indicate an employee poses an insider threat, affect the proper safeguarding of classified information, or indicate classified information has been lost or compromised, including:

(i) Change of ownership or control of the contractor, including stock transfers that affect control of the entity.

(ii) Change of operating name or address of the entity or any of its locations determined eligible for access to classified information.

(iii) Any change to the information previously submitted for KMP including, as appropriate, the names of the individuals the contractor is replacing. A new complete KMP listing need be submitted only at the discretion of the contractor or when requested by the CSA. The contractor will provide a statement indicating:

(A) Whether the new KMP are cleared for access to classified information, and if cleared, to what level they are cleared and when they were cleared, their dates and places of birth, social security numbers, and citizenship.

(B) Whether they have been excluded from access to classified information in accordance with § 117.7(b)(5)(ii).

(C) Whether they have been temporarily excluded from access to classified information pending the determination of eligibility for access to classified information in accordance with § 117.9(g).

(iv) Any action to terminate business or operations for any reason, imminent adjudication or reorganization in bankruptcy, or any change that might affect the validity of the contractor's eligibility for access to classified information.

(v) Any material change concerning the information previously reported concerning foreign ownership, control, or influence (FOCI). This report will be made by the submission of an updated SF 328, “Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interests,” in accordance with CSA-provided guidance. When submitting this information, it is not necessary to repeat answers that have not changed. When entering into discussion, consultations, or agreements that may reasonably lead to effective ownership or control by a foreign interest, the contractor will report the details to the CSA in writing. If the contractor has received a Schedule 13D from the investor, the contractor will forward a copy with the report.

(8) Changes in storage capability. The contractor will report any changes in their storage requirement or capability to safeguard classified material.

(9) Inability to safeguard classified material. The contractor will report any emergency situation that renders their location incapable of safeguarding classified material as soon as possible.

(10) Unsatisfactory conditions of a prime or subcontractors.

(i) Prime contractors, including subcontractors who have in turn subcontracted work, will report any information coming to their attention that may indicate that classified information cannot be adequately protected by a subcontractor, or other circumstances that may impact the validity of the eligibility for access to classified information of any subcontractors.

(ii) Subcontractors will report any information coming to their attention that may indicate that classified information cannot be adequately protected or other circumstances that may impact the validity of the eligibility for access to classified information of their prime contractor.

(11) Dispositioned material previously terminated. The contractor will make a report when the location or disposition of material previously terminated from accountability is subsequently discovered and brought back into accountability.

(12) Foreign classified contracts. Contractors will report any pre-contract negotiation or award not placed through a CSA or U.S. GCA that involves, or may involve:

(i) The release or disclosure of U.S. classified information to a foreign interest.

(ii) Access to classified information furnished by a foreign interest.

(13) Reporting of improper receipt of foreign government material. The contractor will report to the CSA the receipt of classified material from foreign interests that is not received through USG channels.

(14) Reporting by subcontractor. Subcontractors will also notify their prime contractors if they make any reports to their CSA in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (c)(7) through (c)(10) of this section.

(d) Reports of loss, compromise, or suspected compromise. The contractor will report any loss, compromise, or suspected compromise of classified information, U.S. or foreign, to the CSA in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section. Each CSA may provide additional guidance concerning the reporting time period. If the contractor is located on a USG facility, the contractor will submit the report to the CSA and to the head of the USG facility.

(1) Preliminary inquiry. Immediately upon receipt of a security violation report involving classified information, the contractor will initiate a preliminary inquiry to ascertain all of the circumstances surrounding the presumed loss, compromise, or suspected compromise, including validation of the classification of the information.

(2) Initial report. If the contractor's preliminary inquiry confirms that a loss, compromise, or suspected compromise of any classified information occurred, the contractor will promptly submit an initial report of the incident unless otherwise notified by the CSA.

(3) Final report. When the investigation has been completed, the contractor will submit a final report to the CSA which, in turn, will follow CSA procedures to notify the applicable GCA. The report will include:

(i) Material and relevant information that was not included in the initial report.

(ii) The full name and social security number of the individual or individuals primarily responsible for the incident, including a record of prior loss, compromise, or suspected compromise for which the individual had been determined responsible.

(iii) A statement of the corrective action taken to preclude a recurrence.

(iv) Disciplinary action taken against the responsible individual or individuals, if any.

(v) Specific reasons for reaching the conclusion that loss, compromise, or suspected compromise occurred or did not occur.

(4) Employee information in compromise cases. When requested by the CSA, the contractor will report information concerning an employee or other individual, determined to be responsible for the incident, when the information is needed by the CSA for the loss, compromise, or suspected compromise of classified information.

(e) Individual culpability reports. Contractors will establish and enforce policies that provide for appropriate administrative or disciplinary actions taken against employees who violate the requirements of this rule.

(1) Contractors will establish a system to manage and track information regarding employees with eligibility for access to classified information who violate the requirements of this rule in order to be able to identify patterns of negligence or carelessness, or to identify a potential insider threat.

(2) Contractors will establish and apply a graduated scale of administrative and disciplinary actions in the event of employee security violations or negligence in the handling of classified information. CSAs may provide guidance to contractors with examples of administrative or disciplinary actions that the contractor may consider implementing in the event of employee violations or negligence. Contractors are required to submit a final report to the CSA with the findings of an employee's culpability and what corrective actions were taken.

(3) Contractors will include a statement of the administrative or disciplinary actions taken against an employee in a final report to the CSA. A statement must be included when the individual responsible for a security violation can be determined. Contractors' final reports will indicate whether one or more of the following factors are evident:

(i) Involved a deliberate disregard of security requirements.

(ii) Involved negligence in the handling of classified material.

(iii) Was not deliberate in nature but reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, negligence, or carelessness.

(f) CDC cyber incident reports. This paragraph applies only to CDCs and sets forth reporting requirements pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 391 and 393 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement Clause 252.204-7012. The reporting requirements of paragraph (f) of this section are in addition to the requirements in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, which can include certain activities occurring on unclassified information systems. DoD will provide detailed reporting instructions for contractors affected by these references via industrial security letter in accordance with DoDI 5220.22.

(1) Reports to be submitted to the designated DoD CSO. CDCs will immediately report to the DoD CSO, any cyber incident on a classified covered information system that has been approved by that CSO to process classified information.

(i) At a minimum, the report will include:

(A) A description of the technique or method used in the cyber incident.

(B) A sample of the malicious software involved in the cyber incident, if discovered and isolated by the CDC,

(C) A summary of information in connection with any DoD program that has been potentially compromised due to the cyber incident.

(ii) Information that is reported by the CDC (or derived from information reported by the CDC) will be safeguarded, used, and disseminated in a manner consistent with DoD procedures governing the handling of such information pursuant to Public Law 112-239 and 10 U.S.C. 391.

(iii) Reports involving classified foreign government information will be reported to the Director, Defense Technology Security Administration (DoD).

(2) Reports on non-Federal information systems not authorized to process classified information. CDCs will report cyber incidents on non-Federal, unclassified information systems in accordance with contract requirements.

(3) Access to equipment and information by DoD personnel.

(i) The CDC will allow, upon request by DoD personnel, access by DoD personnel to additional equipment or information of the CDC that is necessary to conduct forensic analysis of reportable cyber incidents in addition to any analysis conducted by the CDC.

(ii) The CDC is only required to provide DoD access to equipment or information to determine whether information created by or for DoD in connection with any DoD program was successfully exfiltrated from a CDC's network or information system, and what information was exfiltrated from the CDC's network or information system.

(g) Reports to ISOO.

(1) Contractors will report instances of redundant or duplicative security review and audit activity by the CSAs to the Director, ISOO, for resolution.

(2) Contractors will report instances of CSAs duplicating processing to determine an entity's eligibility for access to classified information when there is an existing determination of an entity's eligibility for access to classified information by another CSA.

§ 117.9 Entity eligibility determination for access to classified information.
(a) General. This section applies to all contractors with entity eligibility determinations, except as provided in § 117.22 for entity eligibility determinations for participation in the CCIPP under the cognizance of DHS.

(1) Prior to the entity being granted an entity eligibility determination for access to classified information, the responsible CSA must have determined that:

(i) The entity is eligible for access to classified information to meet a legitimate USG or foreign government need.

(ii) Access is consistent with national security interests.

(2) The CSA will provide guidance on processing entity eligibility determinations for entity access to classified information.

(3) The determination of entity eligibility for access is separate from the determination of a classified information safeguarding capability (see § 117.15).

(4) Neither the contractor nor its employees will be permitted access to classified information until the CSA has made an entity eligibility determination (e.g., issued an FCL).

(5) The requirement for a favorable entity eligibility determination (also referred to in some instances as an FCL) for a prime contractor includes instances where all access to classified information will be limited to subcontractors. A prime contractor must have a favorable entity eligibility determination at the same or higher classification level as its subcontractors.

(6) Contractors are eligible for storage of classified material in connection with a legitimate USG or foreign government requirement if they have a favorable entity eligibility determination and a classified information safeguarding capability approved by the CSA.

(7) An entity eligibility determination is valid for access to classified information at the same or lower classification level.

(8) Each CSA will maintain a record of entity eligibility determinations made by that CSA.

(9) A contractor will not use its favorable entity eligibility determination for advertising or promotional purposes. This does not prohibit the contractor from advertising employee positions that require a PCL in connection with the position.

(10) A contractor or prospective contractor cannot apply for its own entity eligibility determination. A GCA or a currently cleared contractor may sponsor an entity for an entity eligibility determination at any point during the contracting or agreement life cycle at which the entity must have access to classified information to participate (including the solicitation or competition phase).

(b) Reciprocity. If an entity has an appropriate, final entity eligibility determination, a CSA will not duplicate the entity eligibility determination processes performed by another CSA. If a CSA cannot acknowledge an entity eligibility determination to another CSA, the involved entity may be subject to duplicate processing in accordance with 32 CFR part 2004.

(c) Eligibility requirements. To be eligible for an initial entity eligibility determination or to maintain an existing entity eligibility determination, the entity must:

(1) Need access to classified information in connection with a legitimate USG or foreign government requirement, and access must be consistent with U.S. national security interests as determined by the CSA.

(2) Be organized and existing:

(i) Under the laws of the United States, one of the fifty States, the District of Columbia, or an organized U.S. territory (Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands); or

(ii) Under the laws of an American Indian/Alaska Native tribal entity if:

(A) The American Indian or Alaska Native tribe under whose laws the entity is chartered has been formally acknowledged by the Assistant Secretary—Indian Affairs, of the U.S. Department of the Interior.

(B) The contractor is organized and continues to exist, during the period of the eligibility under a tribal statue or code, or pursuant to a resolution of an authorized tribal legislative body.

(C) The contractor has submitted or will submit records such as a charter, certificate of organization, or other applicable tribal documents and statute or code provisions governing the formation and continuation of the entity, for CSA determination that the entity is tribally chartered.

(3) Be located in the United States or its territorial areas.

(4) Have a record of integrity and lawful conduct in its business dealings.

(5) Have a SMO, FSO, and ITPSO who have and who maintain eligibility for access to classified information and are not excluded from participating in USG contracts or agreements in accordance with § 117.7(b)(1) through § 117.7(b)(3).

(6) Not be under FOCI to such a degree that a favorable entity eligibility determination for access to classified information would be inconsistent with the national interest, in the judgment of the CSA.

(7) Maintain sufficient authorized and cleared employees to manage and implement the requirements of this rule in accordance with CSA guidance.

(8) Not pose an unacceptable risk to national security interests, in the judgment of the CSA.

(9) Meet all requirements governing access to classified information established by the CSA or the relevant authorizing law, regulation, or government-wide policy.

(d) Processing the entity eligibility determination. The CSA will assess the entity's eligibility for access to classified information based on its business structure.

(1) At a minimum, the entity will:

(i) Provide CSA-requested documentation within timelines established by the CSA.

(ii) Have and identify the SMO.

(iii) Appoint a U.S. citizen employee as the FSO.

(iv) Appoint a U.S. citizen employee as the ITPSO.

(v) Submit requests for personnel security investigations for the SMO, FSO, ITPSO, and those other KMP identified by the CSA as requiring eligibility for access to classified information in connection with the entity eligibility.

(2) If the entity is under FOCI with a special security agreement (SSA) as the proposed method of FOCI mitigation, and the GCA requires the entity to have access to proscribed information, the CSA must consider the measures listed in § 117.11(d) as part of the entity eligibility determination.

(e) Other personnel eligibility determinations concurrent with the entity eligibility determination.

(1) Contractors may designate employees who require access to classified information during the negotiation of a contract or the preparation of a bid or quotation pertaining to a prime contract or a subcontract. These designated employees will be processed for a determination of eligibility for access to classified information (i.e., PCL eligibility) concurrent with entity's entity eligibility determination.

(2) The entity eligibility determination is not dependent on the PCL eligibility for access to classified information by such employees, provided none of these employees are among those listed in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. Even so, the employees will not be granted access to classified information until both a favorable entity eligibility determination and PCL eligibility has been granted.

(f) Exclusion procedures. If a CSA determines that certain KMP can be excluded from access to classified information, the contractor will follow the procedures in accordance with § 117.7(b)(5)(ii).

(g) Temporary exclusions. As a result of a changed condition, the SMO or other KMP who require eligibility for access to classified information in connection with the facility entity eligibility determination may be temporarily excluded from access to classified information while in the process of a PCL eligibility determination provided:

(1) The SMO or other KMP are not appointed as the FSO or ITPSO. FSOs and ITPSOs may not be temporarily excluded. A cleared employee must always be appointed to fulfill the requirements of these positions in accordance with this rule.

(2) An employee, cleared to the level of the entity eligibility determination, must be able to fulfill the NISP responsibilities of the temporarily excluded KMP in accordance with this rule while the temporary exclusion is in effect.

(3) The applicable CSA may provide additional guidance on the duration of a temporary exclusion from access to classified information based on circumstances, business structure, and other relevant security information.

(4) The contractor's governing board affirms the exclusion action, and provides a copy of the exclusion action to the CSA. The organization's governing body will document this action.

Table 1 to Paragraph (g)(4) Temporary Exclusion Resolutions

Type of affirmation	Language to be used in exclusion action
Affirmation for Temporary Exclusion from Access to Classified Information	Pending a final determination of eligibility for access to classified information by the U.S. Government, [insert name and position] will not require, will not have, and can be effectively and formally excluded from access to all classified information disclosed to the entity.
Affirmation for Temporary Exclusion from Higher Level Classified Information	Pending a final determination of eligibility for access to classified information at the [insert SECRET or TOP SECRET] level, [insert name and position] will not have, and can be effectively and formally excluded from access to higher-level classified information [specify which higher level of information].
(h) Interim entity eligibility determinations. The CSA may make an interim entity eligibility determination for access to classified information, in the sole discretion of the CSA. See § 117.10(l) for access limitations that also apply to interim entity eligibility determinations.

(i) An interim entity eligibility determination is made on a temporary basis pending completion of the full investigative requirements.

(ii) If the contractor with an interim entity eligibility determination is unable or unwilling to comply with the requirements of this rule and CSA-provided guidance regarding the process to obtain a final entity eligibility determination, the CSA will withdraw the interim entity eligibility.

(i) Multiple facility organizations. The home office must have an entity eligibility determination at the same level as the highest entity eligibility determination of an entity within the MFO. The CSA will determine whether branch offices are eligible for access to classified information if the branch offices need access and meet all other requirements.

(j) Parent-subsidiary relationships. When a parent-subsidiary relationship exists, the CSA will process the parent and the subsidiary separately for entity eligibility determinations.

(1) If the CSA determines the parent must be processed for an entity eligibility determination, then the parent must have an entity eligibility determination at the same or higher level as the subsidiary.

(2) When a parent and subsidiary or multiple cleared subsidiaries are collocated, a formal written agreement to use common security services may be executed by the entities, subject to the approval of the CSA.

(k) Joint ventures. A joint venture may be granted eligibility for access to classified information if it meets the eligibility requirements in paragraph (c) of this section, including:

(1) The joint venture must be established as a legal business entity (e.g. limited liability company, corporation, or partnership). A joint venture established by contract that is not also established as a legal business entity is not eligible for an entity eligibility determination.

(2) The business entity operating as a joint venture must have been awarded a classified contract or sponsored by a GCA or prime contractor for an entity eligibility determination in advance of a potential award for which the business entity has bid pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.

(3) The business entity operating as a joint venture must have an employee or employees appointed as security officials or KMP pursuant to § 117.7(b).

(l) Consultants. The responsible CSA will determine when there is a need for self-employed consultants requiring access to classified information to be considered for an entity eligibility determination.

(m) Limited entity eligibility determination (Non-FOCI).

(1) The applicable CSA may choose to allow a GCA to request limited entity eligibility determinations for a single, narrowly defined contract, agreement, or circumstance and specific to the requesting GCA's classified information. This is not the same as a limited entity eligibility determination in situations involving FOCI, when the FOCI is not mitigated or negated.

(i) Limited entity eligibility determinations (or FCLs) involving FOCI will be processed in accordance with § 117.11(e).

(ii) This paragraph (paragraph (m) of this section) applies to limited entity eligibility determinations for purposes other than FOCI mitigation in accordance with 32 CFR part 2004. Additional guidance may be provided by the responsible CSA.

(2) An entity must be sponsored for a limited entity eligibility determination by a GCA in accordance with the sponsorship requirements contained in paragraph (c) of this section. The contractor should be aware that the sponsorship request from the GCA to the CSA must also include:

(i) Description of the compelling need for the limited entity eligibility determination that is in accordance with U.S. national security interests.

(ii) Specific reason(s) or rationale for limiting the entity eligibility determination.

(iii) The GCA's formal acknowledgement and acceptance of the risk associated with this rationale.

(3) The entity must otherwise meet the entity eligibility determination requirements set out in this rule.

(4) Access limitations are inherent with the limited entity eligibility determination and are imposed upon all of the entity's employees regardless of citizenship.

(5) Contractors should be aware that the CSA will document the requirements of each limited entity eligibility determination it makes, including the scope of, and any limitations on, access to classified information.

(6) Contractors should be aware that the CSA will verify limited entity eligibility determinations only to the requesting GCA. In the case of multiple limited entity eligibility determinations for a single entity, the CSA verifies each one separately only to its requestor.

(7) The applicable CSA administratively terminates the limited entity eligibility determination when there is no longer a need for access to the classified information for which the CSA approved the limited entity eligibility determination.

(n) Termination of the entity eligibility determination. Once granted, a favorable entity eligibility determination remains in effect until terminated or revoked. If the entity eligibility determination is terminated or revoked, the contractor will return all classified material in its possession to the appropriate GCA or dispose of the material as instructed by the CSA. The contractor should be aware that it may request an administrative termination or the CSA may:

(1) After coordination with applicable GCAs, administratively terminate the entity eligibility determination because the contractor no longer has a need for access to classified information.

(2) Revoke an entity eligibility determination if the contractor is unable or unwilling to protect classified information or is unable to comply with the security requirements of this rule.

(o) Invalidation of the entity eligibility determination. The CSA may invalidate an existing entity eligibility determination. While the entity eligibility determination is in an invalidated status, the contractor may not bid on or be awarded new classified contracts or solicitations. The contractor may continue to work on existing classified contracts if the GCA agrees.

(p) Records maintenance. Contractors will maintain the original CSA designated forms for the duration of the entity eligibility determination in accordance with CSA-provided guidance.

§ 117.10 Determination of eligibility for access to classified information for contractor employees.
(a) General.

(1) The CSA is responsible for determining an employee's eligibility for access to classified information.

(i) The contractor must determine that access to classified information is essential in the performance of tasks or services related to the fulfillment of a classified contract.

(ii) Access must be clearly consistent with U.S. national security interests as determined by the CSA.

(iii) A contractor may give an employee access to classified information at the same or lower level of classification as the level of the contractor's entity eligibility determination if the employee has:

(A) A valid need-to-know for the classified information.

(B) A USG favorable eligibility determination for access to classified information at the appropriate level; and

(C) Signed a non-disclosure agreement.

(2) The CSA will determine eligibility for access to classified information in accordance with SEAD 4 (available at: https://www.dni.gov/files/NCSC/documents/Regulations/SEAD-4-Adjudicative-Guidelines-U.pdf) and notify the contractor when eligibility has been granted.

(i) The CSA will notify the contractor when an employee's eligibility has been denied, suspended, or revoked.

(ii) The contractor will immediately deny access to classified information to any employee when notified of a denial, revocation, or suspension of eligibility regardless of the contractor employee's location.

(iii) If the employee's performance is at a USG facility, the contractor will provide notification to the appropriate GCA of any denial, revocation, or suspension of eligibility for access to classified information.

(3) Contractors will annotate and maintain the accuracy of their employees' records in the system of record for contractor eligibility and access to classified information, when one has been designated by the CSA.

(4) Within an MFO or within the same business organization, contractors may centrally manage eligibility for access to classified information and access to classified information records.

(5) The contractor will limit requests for determinations of eligibility for access to classified information to the minimum number of employees and consultants necessary for operational efficiency in accordance with contractual obligations and other requirements of this rule. Requests for determinations of eligibility for access to classified information will not be used to establish a cache of cleared employees.

(6) The contractor will not submit a request for an eligibility determination to one CSA if the employee applicant is known to be cleared or in process for eligibility for access to classified information by another CSA. In such cases, reciprocity of eligibility determination in accordance with SEAD 7 (available at: https://www.dni.gov/files/NCSC/documents/Regulations/SEAD-7_BI_ReciprocityU.pdf) shall be used. The contractor will provide the new CSA with the full name, date, and place of birth, social security number, clearing agency, and type of investigation for verification.

(7) Contractors will not submit requests for determination of eligibility for access to classified information for individuals who are not their employees or consultants; nor will they submit requests for employees of subcontractors.

(8) Access to SCI, SAP, FRD, and RD information is a determination made by the granting authority by the applicable USG granting authority for each category of information.

(b) Investigative requirements. E.O. 13467, as amended, “Reforming Processes Related to Suitability for Government Employment, Fitness for Contractor Employees, and Eligibility for Access to Classified National Security Information,” designates the Security and Suitability Executive Agents responsible for establishing the standards for investigative requirements that apply to contractors.

(1) Investigative tiers. The standards established in accordance with E.O. 13467, as amended, designate specific investigative tiers that are acceptable for access to classified information. An investigative tier is for positions designated as moderate risk, non-critical sensitive, and allow access to information classified at the L, CONFIDENTIAL, and SECRET levels. Another investigative tier is for positions designated as high risk, critical sensitive, special sensitive, and allow access to information classified at the Q, TOP SECRET, and SCI levels.

(2) Investigative coverage.

(i) Automated sources. Investigative providers will use automation whenever possible to collect, verify, corroborate, or discover information about an individual, as documented on the request for investigation or developed from other sources, i.e., automated record checks and inquiries.

(ii) Interviews. Interviews, if required, will cover areas of adjudicative concern.

(iii) Information Covered in Previous Investigations. Information validated in a prior investigation, the results of which are not expected to change (e.g., verification of education degree), will not be repeated as part of subsequent investigations.

(3) Polygraph. Agencies with policies authorizing the use of the polygraph for purposes of determining eligibility for access to classified information may require polygraph examinations when necessary. If adjudicatively relevant information arises during the investigation or the polygraph examination, the investigation may be expanded to resolve the adjudicative concerns.

(4) Financial disclosure. When a GCA requires that a contractor employee complete a financial disclosure form, the contractor will ensure that the employee has the opportunity to complete and submit the form in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, and other applicable provisions of law.

(5) Reinvestigation and Continuous Evaluation. Contractor employees determined eligible for access to classified information will follow CSA guidance to complete reinvestigation and continuous evaluation or continuous vetting requirements. The contractor will validate that the employee requires continued eligibility for access to classified information before initiating the reinvestigation.

(c) Verification of U.S. citizenship. A contractor will require each applicant for determination of eligibility for access to classified information who claims U.S. citizenship to provide evidence of citizenship to the FSO or other authorized representative of the contractor. All documentation must be the original or certified copies of the original documents.

(1) Any document, or its successor, listed in this paragraph is an acceptable document to corroborate U.S. citizenship by birth, including by birth abroad to a U.S. citizen.

(i) A birth certificate certified with the registrar's signature, which bears the raised, embossed, impressed, or multicolored seal of the registrar's office.

(ii) A current or expired U.S. passport or passport card that is unaltered and undamaged and was originally issued to the individual.

(iii) A Department of State Form FS-240, “Consular Report of Birth Abroad of a Citizen of the United States of America.”

(iv) A Department of State Form FS-545 or DS-1350, “Certification of Report of Birth.”

(2) Any document, or its successor, listed in this paragraph is an acceptable document to corroborate U.S. citizenship by certification, naturalization, or birth abroad to a U.S. citizen.

(i) A U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Form N-560 or N-561, “Certification of U.S. Citizenship.”

(ii) A U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Form 550, 551, or 570, “Naturalization Certificate.”

(iii) A valid or expired U.S. passport or passport card that is unaltered and undamaged and was originally issued to the individual.

(d) Procedures for completing the electronic version of the SF 86, “Questionnaire for National Security Positions.” The electronic version of the SF 86 (available at: https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf86.pdf) must be completed in e-QIP or its successor system by the contractor employee and reviewed by the FSO or other contractor employee(s) who has (have) been specifically designated by the contractor to review an employee's SF 86. The FSO or designee will:

(1) Provide the employee with written notification that review of the SF 86 by the FSO or other contractor employee is for adequacy and completeness and information will be used for no other purpose within the entity. The use and disclosure by the U.S. Government, and by U.S. Government contractors operating systems of records on behalf of a U.S. Government agency to accomplish an agency function, of the information provided by the employee on the SF-86 is governed by the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, and by the routine uses published by the USG in the applicable System of Records Notice.

(2) Not share information from the employee's SF 86 within the entity and will not use the information for any purpose other than determining the adequacy and completeness of the SF 86.

(e) Fingerprint collection. The contractor will submit fingerprints in accordance with CSA guidance. Contractors will use digital fingerprints whenever possible.

(f) Pre-employment eligibility determination action.

(1) If a potential employee requires access to classified information immediately upon commencement of employment, the contractor may submit a request for investigation prior to the date of employment, provided:

(i) A written commitment for employment has been made by the contractor.

(ii) The candidate has accepted the offer in writing.

(2) The commitment for employment must indicate employment will commence within 45 days of the employee being granted eligibility for access to classified information at a level that allows them to perform the tasks or services associated with the contract or USG requirement for which they were hired.

(3) Contractors will comply with the requirements pursuant to paragraph (a) (5) of this section.

(g) Classified information NDA. The NDA designated by the CSA (e.g., SF 312), is an agreement between the USG and an individual who is determined eligible for access to classified information.

(1) An employee determined eligible for access to classified information must execute an NDA prior to being granted access to classified information.

(2) The employee must sign and date the NDA in the presence of a witness. The employee's and witness' signatures must bear the same date.

(3) The contractor will forward the executed NDA to the CSA for retention. The CSA may authorize the contractor to retain a copy of the form for administrative purposes, if appropriate.

(4) If the employee refuses to execute the NDA, the contractor will deny the employee access to classified information and submit a report to the CSA in accordance with § 117.8(c)(6).

(h) Reciprocity. The applicable CSA is responsible for determining whether contractor employees have been previously determined eligible for access to classified information or investigated by an authorized investigative activity in accordance with SEAD 7 (available at: https://www.dni.gov/files/NCSC/documents/Regulations/SEAD-7_BI_ReciprocityU.pdf).

(1) Any current eligibility determination for access to classified information that is based on an investigation of a scope that meets or exceeds that necessary for the required level of access will provide the basis for a new eligibility determination.

(2) The prior investigation will be used without further investigation or adjudication unless the CSA becomes aware of significant derogatory information that was not previously adjudicated.

(i) Break in access. There are circumstances when a contractor administratively terminates an employee's access to classified information solely because of no current requirement for such access. If the employee again requires access to classified information and has been in the contractor's continuous employment, and the employee again requires access to classified information, the contractor may provide access to classified information without further investigation, based on CSA guidance, so long as the employee remains eligible for access to classified information and has a current investigation of a scope that meets or exceeds that necessary for the access required and no new derogatory information is known. Any adverse information from or about the employee must continue to be reported while the employee maintains eligibility for access to classified information, even when access to classified information has been administratively terminated.

(j) Break in employment.

(1) When an employee had a break in employment and now requires access to classified information, the contractor may provide access to classified information based on CSA guidance provided the employee remains eligible for access to classified information and has a current investigation of a scope that meets or exceeds that necessary for the access required.

(2) The contractor may not provide access to classified information to an employee who previously was eligible for access to classified information, but has had a break in employment that resulted in a loss of eligibility without a new eligibility determination by the CSA.

(k) Non-U.S. citizens.

(1) Contractors must make every effort to ensure that non-U.S. citizens are not employed in duties that may require access to classified information. However, compelling reasons may exist to grant access to classified information to a non-U.S. citizen. The CSA may grant such individuals a LAA in those rare circumstances where a non-U.S. citizen possesses unique or unusual skills or expertise that is urgently needed to support a specific USG contract involving access to specified classified information, and a cleared or clearable U.S. citizen is not readily available. The CSA will provide specific procedures for requesting an LAA, to include the need for approval by a GCA senior official.

(2) An LAA granted under the provisions of this rule is not valid for access to:

(i) TOP SECRET information.

(ii) RD or FRD.

(iii) Information that has not been determined releasable by a USG designated disclosure authority to the country of which the individual is a citizen.

(iv) Communications security (COMSEC) information.

(v) Intelligence information.

(vi) NATO information. Foreign nationals of a NATO member nation may be authorized access to NATO information provided:

(A) The CSA obtains a NATO security clearance certificate from the individual's country of citizenship.

(B) NATO access is limited to performance on a specific NATO contract.

(vii) Information for which foreign disclosure has been prohibited in whole or in part.

(viii) Information provided to the USG in confidence by a third-party government.

(ix) Classified information furnished by a third-party government.

(l) Temporary eligibility for access to classified information. In accordance with SEAD 8 (available at: https://www.dni.gov/files/NCSC/documents/Regulations/SEAD-8_Temporary_Eligibility_U.pdf), the CSA may grant temporary (previously called interim) eligibility for access to classified information, as appropriate, to applicants for access to TOP SECRET, SECRET, and CONFIDENTIAL information. This eligibility may only be granted if there is no evidence of adverse information that calls into question an individual's eligibility for access to classified information. If results are favorable following completion of full investigative requirements, the CSA will update the temporary eligibility determination for access to classified information to be final. In any case, a temporary eligibility determination shall not exceed one year unless approved by the applicable CSA in the system of record. Non-U.S. citizens are not eligible for access to classified information on a temporary basis.

(1) A temporary SECRET or CONFIDENTIAL eligibility determination is valid for access to classified information at the level of the eligibility granted. Access to RD, COMSEC information, and NATO information requires a final SECRET eligibility determination.

(2) A temporary TOP SECRET eligibility determination is valid for access to TOP SECRET information. If an individual has a temporary TOP SECRET eligibility determination and has a final SECRET eligibility determination based on a previously completed investigation, the temporary TOP SECRET eligibility determination is valid for access to RD, NATO, and COMSEC information at the SECRET or CONFIDENTIAL level.

(3) Access to SCI and SAP information based on a temporary eligibility determination is a determination made by the granting authority.

(4) When a temporary eligibility determination has been made and derogatory information is subsequently developed, the CSA may withdraw the temporary eligibility pending completion of the processing that is a prerequisite to the final eligibility determination.

(5) When a temporary eligibility determination is withdrawn for an individual who is required to be eligible for access to classified information in connection with the entity eligibility determination for access to classified information, the contractor must remove the individual from access to classified information and any KMP position requiring PCL eligibility or the temporary entity eligibility determination will also be withdrawn.

(6) Withdrawal of a temporary eligibility determination is not a denial, termination, or revocation of eligibility under this rule and may not be appealed.

(m) Consultants.

(1) A consultant will not access classified information off the premises of the using (hiring) contractor except in connection with authorized classified visits.

(2) A contractor may only assign a consultant outside the United States with responsibilities requiring access to classified information when:

(i) The consultant agreement between the contractor and consultant includes:

(A) Identification of the contract, license, or agreement that requires access to classified information, the level of classified information that is required, and access to FGI by the consultant while assigned outside the United States.

(B) A formal agreement that prohibits the consultant from disclosing any classified information related to the contract, license, or agreement as required in paragraph (m)(i)(A) of this section to any party other than the USG or foreign government with which the consultant is meeting, and who possesses the requisite clearance and need to know.

(ii) The consultant and the using contractor will jointly execute the consultant agreement setting forth respective security responsibilities. The contractor will retain an original signed copy of the agreement and will ensure its availability if requested by the CSA.

(iii) The contractor, in consultation with the applicable CSA as appropriate, will determine what threat briefing(s) the consultant should receive before the assignment, and conduct those briefings as part of the consultant's pre-assignment and recurring security training.

(iv) The contractor provides notice of any changes to the consultant agreement to the applicable CSA during assessments or upon CSA request.

(3) The using contractor will be the consumer of the consultant services as set forth in the consultant agreement.

(4) For security administration purposes, a consultant will be considered an employee of the using contractor for compliance with this rule.

(5) Consultants to GCAs are not under the purview of the NISP and will be processed for determination of eligibility by the GCA in accordance with GCA procedures.

§ 117.11 Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI).
(a) General. Foreign investment can play an important role in maintaining the vitality of the U.S. industrial base. Therefore, it is the intent of the USG to allow foreign investment consistent with the national security interests of the United States. The following FOCI procedures for cleared U.S. entities are intended to mitigate the risks associated with FOCI by ensuring that foreign firms cannot undermine U.S. security to gain unauthorized access to classified information.

(1) The CSA will consider a U.S. entity to be under FOCI when:

(i) A foreign interest has the power to direct or decide issues affecting the entity's management or operations in a manner that could either:

(A) Result in unauthorized access to classified information; or

(B) Adversely affect performance of a classified contract or agreement.

(ii) The foreign government is currently exercising, or could prospectively exercise, that power, whether directly or indirectly, such as:

(A) Through ownership of the U.S. entity's securities, by contractual arrangements, or other means, or;

(B) By the ability to control or influence the election or appointment of one or more members to the entity's governing board.

(2) When the CSA has determined that an entity is under FOCI, the primary consideration will be the protection of classified information. The CSA will take whatever action is necessary to protect classified information, in coordination with other affected agencies as appropriate.

(3) A U.S. entity that is in process for an entity eligibility determination for access to classified information and subsequently determined to be under FOCI is ineligible for access to classified information unless and until effective security measures have been put in place to negate or mitigate FOCI to the satisfaction of the CSA.

(4) When a contractor determined to be under FOCI is negotiating an acceptable FOCI mitigation or negation measure in good faith, an existing entity eligibility determination may continue in effect so long as there is no indication that classified information is at risk of compromise in consultation with the applicable GCA. The applicable CSA may decide that circumstances involving the FOCI are such that the entity eligibility determination will be invalidated until implementation of an acceptable FOCI mitigation plan.

(5) An existing entity eligibility determination will be invalidated if the contractor is unable or unwilling to negotiate and implement an acceptable FOCI mitigation or negation measure. An existing entity eligibility determination will be revoked if security measures cannot be taken to remove the possibility of unauthorized access to classified information or adverse effect on performance of classified contracts.

(6) Changed conditions, such as a change in ownership, indebtedness, or a foreign intelligence threat, may justify certain adjustments to the security terms under which an entity is operating or, alternatively, that a different FOCI mitigation or negation method be employed. If a changed condition is of sufficient significance, it might also result in a determination that a contractor is no longer considered to be under FOCI, or, conversely, that a contractor is no longer eligible for access to classified information.

(7) The USG reserves the right, and has the obligation, to impose any security method, safeguard, or restriction (including denial, termination or revocation of an entity eligibility determination) it believes necessary to ensure that unauthorized access to classified information is effectively precluded and performance of classified contracts is not adversely affected.

(8) Nothing contained in this section affects the authority of a Federal agency head to limit, deny, or revoke access to classified information under its statutory, regulatory, or contract jurisdiction.

(b) Factors. Factors relating to the entity, relevant foreign interests, and the government of such foreign interests, as appropriate, will be considered in the aggregate to determine whether an applicant entity is under FOCI, its eligibility for access to classified information, and the protective measures required. These factors include:

(1) Record of espionage against U.S. targets, either economic or government.

(2) Record of enforcement actions against the entity for transferring technology without authorization.

(3) Record of compliance with pertinent U.S. laws, regulations, and contracts or agreements.

(4) Type and sensitivity of the information the entity would access.

(5) Source, nature, and extent of FOCI, including whether foreign interests hold a majority or minority position in the entity, taking into consideration the immediate, intermediate, and ultimate parent entities.

(6) Nature of any relevant bilateral and multilateral security and information exchange agreements.

(7) Ownership or control, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by a foreign government.

(8) Any other factor that indicates or demonstrates capability of foreign interests to control or influence the entity's operations or management.

(c) Procedures. An entity is required to complete an SF 328 during the process for an entity eligibility determination or when significant changes occur to information previously submitted. In the case of a corporate family, the form may be a consolidated response rather than separate submissions from individual members of the corporate family based on CSA guidance.

(1) If an entity provides any affirmative answers on the SF 328, or the CSA receives other information which indicates that the applicant entity may be under FOCI, the CSA will make a risk-based determination regarding the relative significance of the information in regard to:

(i) Whether the applicant is under FOCI.

(ii) The extent and manner to which the FOCI represents a risk to the national security or may adversely impact classified contract performance.

(iii) The type of actions, if any, that would be necessary to mitigate or negate the effects of FOCI to a level deemed acceptable to the USG. The CSA will advise entities on the CSA's appeal channels for disputing CSA FOCI determinations.

(2) When an entity with a favorable eligibility determination enters into negotiations for the proposed merger, acquisition, or takeover by a foreign interest, the entity will submit notification to the CSA of the commencement of such negotiations.

(i) The submission will include the type of transaction under negotiation (e.g., stock purchase, asset purchase), the identity of the potential foreign interest investor, and a plan to negate or mitigate the FOCI by a method outlined in paragraph (d) of this section.

(ii) The entity will submit copies of loan, purchase, and shareholder agreements, annual reports, bylaws, articles of incorporation, partnership agreements, other organizational documents, and reports filed with other Federal agencies to the CSA.

(d) FOCI action plans.

(1) When FOCI factors not related to ownership are present, the CSA will determine if positive measures will assure the CSA that the foreign interest can be effectively mitigated and cannot otherwise adversely affect performance on classified contracts. Examples of such measures include:

(i) Modification or termination of loan agreements, contracts, and other understandings with foreign interests.

(ii) Diversification or reduction of foreign-source income.

(iii) Demonstration of financial viability independent of foreign interests.

(iv) Elimination or resolution of problem debt.

(v) Assignment of specific oversight duties and responsibilities to board members.

(vi) Formulation of special executive-level security committees to consider and oversee issues that affect the performance of classified contracts.

(vii) Physical or organizational separation of the contractor component performing on classified contracts.

(viii) Adoption of special board resolutions.

(ix) Other actions that negate or mitigate foreign control or influence.

(x) A combination of these methods, as determined by the CSA.

(2) When FOCI factors related to ownership are present, methods the CSA may apply to negate or mitigate the risk of foreign ownership include, but are not limited to:

(i) Board resolution.

(A) When a foreign interest does not possess voting interests sufficient to elect, or otherwise is not entitled to representation on the entity's governing board, a resolution(s) by the governing board may be adequate. In the resolution, the governing board will:

(1) Identify the foreign shareholder.

(2) Describe the type and number of foreign-owned shares.

(3) Acknowledge the entity's obligation to comply with all industrial security program requirements.

(4) Certify that the foreign owner does not require, will not have, and can be effectively precluded from unauthorized access to all classified information entrusted to or held by the entity.

(B) The governing board will provide for annual certifications to the CSA acknowledging the continued effectiveness of the resolution.

(C) The entity will distribute to members of its governing board and to its KMP copies of such resolutions, and report in the entity's corporate records the completion of such distribution.

(ii) Security control agreement (SCA). When a foreign interest does not effectively own or control an entity (i.e., the entity is under U.S. control), but the foreign interest is entitled to representation on the entity's governing board, an SCA may be adequate. At least one cleared U.S. citizen must serve as an outside director on the entity's governing board. There are no access limitations under an SCA.

(iii) SSA. When a foreign interest effectively owns or controls an entity, an SSA may be adequate. An SSA is an arrangement that, based upon an assessment of the source and nature of FOCI and FOCI factors, imposes various industrial security measures within an institutionalized set of entity practices and procedures. The SSA preserves the foreign owner's right to be represented on the entity's board or governing body with a direct voice in the entity's business management, while denying the foreign owner majority representation and unauthorized access to classified information.

(A) Requirement for a National Interest Determination (NID). Unless otherwise prohibited by law or regulation (e.g., Section 842 of Pub. L. 115-232), the applicable CSA must determine whether allowing an entity access to proscribed information under an SSA is consistent with national security interests of the U.S. with concurrence from controlling agencies, as applicable. Such NIDs will be made as part of an entity eligibility determination or because of a changed condition when a GCA requires an entity to have access to proscribed information and the CSA proposes an SSA as the mitigation measure. The NID can be program, project, or contract specific.

(B) NID process:

(1) The CSA makes a NID for TOP SECRET or SAP information to which the entity requires access. Contractors should be aware that DOE Order 470.4B provides additional information and requirements for processing NID requests for access to RD.

(2) In cases in which any category of the proscribed information is controlled by another agency (ODNI for SCI, DOE for RD, the National Security Agency (NSA) for COMSEC), the CSA asks that controlling agency to concur or non-concur on the NID for that category of information.

(3) The CSA informs the GCA and the entity when the NID is complete. In cases involving SCI, RD, or COMSEC, the CSA also informs the GCA and the entity when a controlling agency concurs or non-concurs on that agency's category of proscribed information. The entity may begin accessing a category of proscribed information once the CSA informs the GCA and the entity that the controlling agency concurs, even if other categories of proscribed information are pending concurrence.

(4) An entity's access to SCI, RD, or COMSEC remains in effect so long as the entity remains eligible for access to classified information and the contract or agreement (or program or project) which imposes the requirement for access to those categories of proscribed information remains in effect, except under any of the following circumstances:

(i) The CSA, GCA, or controlling agency becomes aware of adverse information that impacts the entity eligibility determination.

(ii) The CSA's threat assessment pertaining to the entity indicates a risk to one of the categories of proscribed information.

(iii) The CSA becomes aware of any material change regarding the source, nature, and extent of FOCI.

(iv) The entity's record of NISP compliance, based on CSA reviews, becomes less than satisfactory. Consult DOE Order 470.4B for additional information and requirements for processing NID requests for access to RD.

(5) Under any of the circumstances in paragraphs (d)(2)(iii)(B)(4)(i) through (d)(2)(iii)(B)(4)(iv) in this section, the CSA determines whether the entity remains eligible for access to classified information, it must change the FOCI mitigation measure in order to remain eligible for access to classified information, or the CSA must terminate or revoke the access to classified information.

(6) When an entity is eligible for access to classified information that includes a favorable NID for SCI, RD, or COMSEC, the CSA does not have to request a new NID concurrence for the same entity if the access to classified information requirements for the relevant category of proscribed information and terms remain unchanged for:

(i) Renewing the contract or agreement.

(ii) New task orders issued under the contract or agreement.

(iii) A new contract or agreement that contains the same provisions as the previous one (this usually applies when the contract or agreement is for a program or project.)

(iv) Renewing the SSA.

(7) Under certain conditions, entities under an SSA may not require a NID for one or more categories of proscribed information in accordance with CSA-provided guidance. Categories of proscribed information for entities under SSAs not requiring a NID will be recorded in the CSA's system of record for entity eligibility determinations.

(iv) Voting Trust (VT) or Proxy Agreement (PA). The VT and the PA are arrangements that vest the voting rights of the foreign-owned stock in cleared U.S. citizens approved by the USG. Under a VT, the foreign owner transfers legal title its ownership interests in the entity to the trustees. Under a PA, the foreign owner's voting rights are conveyed to the proxy holders. Neither arrangement imposes any restrictions on the entity's eligibility to have access to classified information or to compete for classified contracts.

(A) Establishment of a VT or PA involves the selection of trustees or proxy holders, all of whom must become members of the entity's governing board. Both arrangements must provide for the exercise of all prerogatives of ownership by the trustees or proxy holders with complete freedom to act independently from the foreign owners, except as provided in the VT or PA. The arrangements may limit the authority of the trustees or proxy holders by requiring approval be obtained from the foreign owner with respect to issues such as:

(1) The sale or disposal of the entity's assets or a substantial part thereof.

(2) Pledges, mortgages, or other encumbrances on the entity's assets, capital stock, or ownership interests.

(3) Mergers, consolidations, or reorganizations.

(4) Dissolution.

(5) Filing of a bankruptcy petition.

(B) The trustees or proxy holders may consult with the foreign owner, or vice versa, where otherwise consistent with U.S. laws, regulations, and the terms of the VT or PA.

(C) The trustees or proxy holders assume full responsibility for the foreign owner's voting interests and for exercising all governance and management prerogatives relating thereto to ensure the foreign owner will be insulated from the entity, thereby solely retaining the status of a beneficiary. The entity must be organized, structured, and financed to be capable of operating as a viable business entity and independent from the foreign owners' interests that required FOCI mitigation or negation.

(v) Combination measures. The CSA may apply combinations of the measures in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (d)(2)(iv) in this section or other similar measures that effectively mitigate or negate the risks involved with foreign ownership.

(e) Limited entity eligibility determination due to FOCI. In accordance with the provisions of this section and CSA-provided guidance, a limited entity eligibility determination may be an option for a single, narrowly defined contract, agreement, or circumstance for entities under FOCI without mitigation or negation. Limitations on access to classified information are inherent with the granting of limited entity eligibility determinations and are imposed upon all of the entity's employees regardless of citizenship.

(1) In exceptional circumstances, when an entity is under FOCI, the CSA may decide that a limited entity eligibility determination is appropriate when the entity is unable or unwilling to implement FOCI mitigation or negation measures, and the conditions in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section are met. This is not the same as a limited entity eligibility determination for purposes not related to FOCI. Information on limited entity eligibility determinations for purposes other than FOCI can be found in § 117.9(m). A CSA may decide that a limited entity eligibility is appropriate for an entity under FOCI if:

(i) The limited entity eligibility determination is in accordance with national security interests and a GCA has informed the CSA that access to classified information by the contractor is essential to contract or agreement performance.

(ii) There is an industrial security agreement with the foreign government of the country from which the FOCI is derived.

(iii) The contractor meets all other entity eligibility requirements outlined in § 117.9(c) except that KMP, other than the FSO, may be citizens of the country from which the FOCI derives and the United States has obtained security assurances at the appropriate level from that country.

(2) A U.S. subsidiary of a foreign entity may be sponsored for a limited entity eligibility determination by a foreign government when the foreign government desires to award a contract or agreement to the U.S. subsidiary that involves access to only that classified information for which the foreign government is the OCA.

(3) Limited entity eligibility determinations are specific to the classified information for the requesting GCA or foreign government and the single narrowly defined contract, agreement, or circumstance the request was based on. The limited entity eligibility determination will only be verified to that GCA or foreign government for the authorized level of access to classified information and any limitations to that access to classified information.

(4) A limited entity eligibility determination is not an option for contractors that require access to proscribed information when a foreign government has ownership or control over the entity.

(5) Release of classified information must be in conformity with the U.S. National Disclosure Policy-1 (provided to designated disclosure authorities on a need-to-know basis from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, Defense Technology Security Administration).

(6) A limited entity eligibility determination will be administratively terminated when there is no longer a need for the contractor to access the classified information for which it was sponsored. Administrative termination of one limited entity eligibility determination does not impact a contractor's other limited entity eligibility determinations.

(7) If there is no industrial security agreement with the foreign government of the country from which the FOCI is derived, in extraordinary circumstances, a limited entity eligibility determination may also be granted if there is a compelling need to do so consistent with U.S. national security interests and the GCA has informed the applicable CSA that access to classified information by the contractor is essential to contract or agreement performance. Under this circumstance, the entity must follow all provisions of this rule.

(f) Qualifications of trustees, proxy holders, and outside directors. Individuals who serve as trustees, proxy holders, or outside directors must meet the following criteria:

(1) Trustees and proxy holders must be resident U.S. citizens who can exercise governance and management prerogatives relating to their position in a way that ensures that the foreign owner can be effectively insulated from the entity.

(2) Outside directors must be resident U.S. citizens who can exercise governance and management prerogatives relating to their position in a way that ensures that the foreign owner can be effectively separated from the entity's classified work.

(3) New trustees, proxy holders, and outside directors must be completely disinterested individuals with no prior involvement with the entity, the entities with which it is affiliated, or the foreign owner.

(4) The CSA may consider other circumstances that may affect an individual's eligibility to serve effectively including the number of boards on which the individual serves, the length of time serving on any other governance boards, and other factors in accordance with CSA-provided guidance.

(5) Trustees, proxy holders, and outside directors must be determined eligible for access to classified information at the level of the entity eligibility determination for access to classified information. Individuals who are serving as trustees, proxy holders, or outside directors as part of a mitigation measure for the entity are not considered to have prior involvement solely by performing that role for purposes of paragraph (f)(3) of this section.

(g) Government security committee (GSC). Under a VT, PA, SSA, or SCA, the contractor is required to establish a permanent committee of its board of directors, known as the GSC.

(1) Unless otherwise approved by the CSA, the GSC consists of trustees, proxy holders, or outside directors and those officer directors who have been determined to be eligible for access to classified information.

(2) The members of the GSC are required to ensure that the contractor adheres to laws and regulations and maintains internal entity policies and procedures to safeguard classified information entrusted to it. The GSC ensures that violations of those policies and procedures are promptly investigated and reported to the appropriate authority when it has been determined that a violation has occurred.

(3) The contractor's FSO will be the principal advisor to the GSC and attend GSC meetings. The chairman of the GSC must concur with the appointment and replacement of FSOs selected by management. The FSO functions will be carried out under the authority of the GSC.

(h) Additional procedures for FOCI mitigation or negation measures. In addition to the basic requirements of the FOCI mitigation or negation agreement, the entity may be required to document and implement additional procedures based upon the circumstances of an entity's operations. Those additional procedures will be established in supplements to the FOCI mitigation agreement to allow for flexibility as circumstances change without having to renegotiate the entire agreement. When making use of supplements, the CSA does not consider the FOCI mitigation measure final until the CSA has approved the required supplements. These supplements may include:

(1) Technology control plan (TCP). A TCP approved by the CSA will be developed and implemented by those entities cleared under a VT, PA, SSA and SCA and when otherwise deemed appropriate by the CSA. The TCP will prescribe all security measures determined necessary to reasonably prevent the possibility of access by non-U.S. citizen employees and visitors to information for which they are not authorized. The TCP will also prescribe measures designed to assure that access by non-U.S. citizens is strictly limited to only that specific information for which appropriate USG disclosure authorization has been obtained, e.g., an approved export license or technical assistance agreement. Unique badging, escort, segregated work area, security indoctrination schemes, and other measures will be included, as appropriate.

(2) Electronic communications plan (ECP). The contractor will develop and implement an ECP, subject to CSA approval, tailored to the contractor's operations to verify that electronic controls are in place for clear technical and logical separation of electronic communications and networks between the contractor, the foreign interest, and its affiliates. The purpose is to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of classified information to the foreign parent or its affiliates. The contractor will include in the ECP a detailed network description and configuration diagram that clearly delineates which networks will be shared and which will be protected from access by the foreign parent or its affiliates. The network description will address firewalls, remote administration, monitoring, maintenance, and separate email servers, as appropriate.

(3) Affiliated operations plan. There may be circumstances when the parties to a transaction propose in the FOCI action plan that the U.S. contractor provides certain services for the foreign interest or enters into arrangements with the foreign interest, or the foreign interest provides services for or enters into arrangements with the U.S. contractor. In such circumstances, the contractor will document a plan, subject to CSA approval, outlining the entity's consolidated policies and procedures regarding the control of affiliated operations, regardless of whether such endeavors are administrative, operational, or commercial, performed directly or through third-party service providers, within the entity, or among any of the entity's controlled entities, or the foreign interest and its affiliates.

(4) Facilities location plan. When a contractor is potentially collocated with or in close proximity to its foreign parent or an affiliate, the contractor will prepare a facilities location plan to assist the CSA in determining if the contractor is collocated or if the close proximity can be allowed under the FOCI mitigation plan. A U.S. entity generally cannot be collocated with the foreign parent or affiliate, i.e., at the same address or in the same location.

(i) Annual review and certification —

(1) Annual review. The CSA will meet at least annually, and otherwise as required by circumstances, with the GSCs of contractors operating under a VT, PA, SSA, or SCA to review the purpose and effectiveness of the clearance arrangement and to establish a common understanding of the operating requirements and their implementation. These reviews will include an examination of:

(i) Acts of compliance or noncompliance with the approved security arrangement, standard rules, and applicable laws and regulations.

(ii) Problems or impediments associated with the practical application or utility of the security arrangement.

(iii) Whether security controls, practices, or procedures warrant adjustment.

(2) Annual certification. For contractors operating under a VT, PA, SSA, or SCA, the chairman of the GSC will submit to the CSA one year from the effective date of the agreement and annually thereafter, an implementation and compliance report. Such reports will include:

(i) A detailed description of the manner in which the contractor is carrying out its obligations under the agreement.

(ii) Changes to security procedures, implemented or proposed, and the reasons for those changes.

(iii) A detailed description of any acts of noncompliance, whether inadvertent or intentional, with a discussion of remedial measures, including steps taken to prevent such acts from recurring.

(iv) Any changes, or impending changes, of KMP or key board members, including the reasons therefore.

(v) Any changes or impending changes in the organizational structure or ownership, including any reorganizations, acquisitions, mergers, or divestitures.

(vi) Any other issues that could have a bearing on the effectiveness of the applicable agreement.

(j) Transactions involving foreign persons, and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).

(1) The CFIUS is a USG interagency committee chaired by the Treasury Department that conducts assessments, reviews and investigations of transactions that could result in foreign control of a U.S. business, and certain non-controlling investments and certain real estate transactions involving foreign persons under 50 U.S.C. 4565.

(2) In CFIUS cases where the acquired U.S. business requires access to classified information, the CFIUS assessment, review or investigation, as applicable, and the CSA industrial security FOCI review are carried out in parallel, but are separate processes with different time constraints and considerations.

(3) The CSA will promptly advise the parties in a transaction under CFIUS review that would require FOCI negation or mitigation measures if consummated, to submit to the CSA a plan to negate or mitigate FOCI. If it appears that an agreement cannot be reached on material terms of a FOCI action plan, or if the U.S. person that is a party, or in applicable cases, a subject of the proposed transaction fails to comply with the FOCI reporting requirements of this rule, the CSA may recommend a full investigation of the transaction by the CFIUS to determine the effects on national security.

§ 117.12 Security training and briefings.
(a) General. Contractors will provide all cleared employees with security training and briefings commensurate with their involvement with classified information.

(b) Training materials. Contractors may obtain security, threat awareness, and other education and training information and material from their CSA or other sources.

(c) Government provided briefings. The CSA is responsible for providing initial security briefings to the FSO and for ensuring other briefings required for special categories of information are provided to the FSO.

(d) FSO training. Contractors will ensure the FSO and others performing security duties complete training considered appropriate by the CSA. Training requirements will be based on the contractor's involvement with classified information. Training may include an FSO orientation course, and for FSOs at contractor locations with a classified information safeguarding capability, an FSO program management course. Contractor FSOs will complete training within six months of appointment to the position of FSO. When determined by the applicable CSA, contractor FSOs must complete an FSO program management course within six months of the CSA approval to store classified information at the contractor.

(e) Initial security briefings. Prior to being granted access to classified information, contractors will provide employees with an initial security briefing that includes:

(1) Threat awareness, including insider threat awareness in accordance with paragraph (g) in this section.

(2) Counterintelligence (CI) awareness.

(3) Overview of the information security classification system.

(4) Reporting obligations and requirements, including insider threat.

(5) Cybersecurity training for all authorized information system users in accordance with CSA-provided guidance pursuant to § 117.18(a)(1) and (a)(2).

(6) Security procedures and duties applicable to the employee's position requirements (e.g. marking and safeguarding of classified information) and criminal, civil, or administrative consequences that may result from the unauthorized disclosure of classified information, even though the individual has not yet signed an NDA.

(f) CUI training. While outside the requirements of the NISPOM, when a classified contract includes provisions for CUI training, contractors will comply with those contract requirements.

(g) Insider threat training. The designated ITPSO will ensure that contractor program personnel assigned insider threat program responsibilities and all other cleared employees complete training consistent with applicable CSA provided guidance.

(1) The contractor will provide training to insider threat program personnel, including the contractor's designated ITPSO, on:

(i) CI and security fundamentals.

(ii) Procedures for conducting insider threat response actions.

(iii) Applicable laws and regulations regarding the gathering, integration, retention, safeguarding, and use of records and data, including the consequences of misuse of such information.

(iv) Applicable legal, civil liberties, and privacy policies and requirements applicable to insider threat programs.

(2) The contractor will provide insider threat awareness training to all cleared employees on an annual basis. Depending upon CSA specific guidance, a CSA may instead conduct such training. The contractor must provide all newly cleared employees with insider threat awareness training before granting access to classified information. Training will address current and potential threats in the work and personal environment and will include at a minimum:

(i) The importance of detecting potential insider threats by cleared employees and reporting suspected activity to the insider threat program designee.

(ii) Methodologies of adversaries to recruit trusted insiders and collect classified information, in particular within information systems.

(iii) Indicators of insider threat behavior and procedures to report such behavior.

(iv) CI and security reporting requirements, as applicable.

(3) The contractor will establish procedures to validate all cleared employees who have completed the initial and annual insider threat training.

(h) Derivative classification —

(1) Initial training. The contractor will ensure all employees authorized to make derivative classification decisions are trained in the proper application of the derivative classification principles, in accordance with CSA direction. Employees are not authorized to conduct derivative classification until they receive such training.

(2) Refresher training. In addition to the initial training, contractors will ensure all employees who conduct derivative classification receive training at least once every two years. Contractors will suspend an employee's derivative classification authority for any employee who does not receive such training at least once every two years. Training will emphasize the avoidance of over-classification and address:

(i) Classification levels.

(ii) Duration of classification.

(iii) Identification and markings.

(iv) Classification prohibitions and limitations.

(v) Sanctions and classification challenges.

(vi) Security classification guides.

(vii) Information sharing.

(3) Record of training. Contractors will retain records of the date of the most recent training (initial or refresher) and type of training provided to employees.

(i) Information systems security. All information system authorized users will receive training on the security risks associated with their user activities and responsibilities under the NISP. The contractor will determine the appropriate content of the training, taking into consideration assigned roles and responsibilities, specific security requirements, and the information system to which personnel are authorized access.

(j) Temporary help suppliers. A cleared temporary help supplier, or other contractor who employs cleared individuals solely for dispatch elsewhere, will be responsible for ensuring that required briefings (both initial and refresher training) are provided to their cleared personnel. The temporary help supplier or the using contractor may conduct these briefings.

(k) Refresher training. The contractor will provide all cleared employees with security education and training every 12 months. Refresher training will reinforce the information provided during the initial security briefing and will keep cleared employees informed of changes in security regulations and should also address issues or concerns identified during contractor self-reviews. Training methods may include group briefings, interactive videos, dissemination of instructional materials, or other media and methods. Contractors will maintain records about the programs offered and employee participation in them.

(l) Debriefings. Contractors will debrief cleared employees and annotate the debriefing in the appropriate contractor records when access to classified information is no longer needed; at the time of termination of employment (discharge, resignation, or retirement); when an employee's eligibility for access to classified information is terminated, suspended, or revoked; and upon termination of the entity eligibility determination.

§ 117.13 Classification.
(a) Original classification. Only a USG official designated or delegated the authority in writing can make an original classification decision.

(1) An OCA classifies information pursuant to E.O. 13526 and 32 CFR part 2001, designates and marks it as TOP SECRET, SECRET, or CONFIDENTIAL, and, except as provided by statute, may use no other terms to identify classified information.

(2) The designation UNCLASSIFIED is used to identify information that does not meet the criteria for classification in accordance with E.O. 13526. In accordance with 32 CFR 2002, CUI implementing guidance (including the Marking Handbook) and any GCA-provided guidance, CUI commingled with classified information must be marked as CUI to alert users to its presence and sensitivity. The CUI regulation, guidance, and handbook are available at: https://www.archives.gov/cui.

(b) Derivative classification.

(1) Contractor personnel make derivative classification decisions when they incorporate, paraphrase, restate, or generate in new form, information that is already classified. They must mark the newly developed material consistently with the classification markings that apply to the source information.

(2) Derivative classification is the classification of information based on guidance from an OCA, which may be either a properly marked source document or a current security classification guide provided by a GCA in accordance with E.O. 13526. The duplication or reproduction of existing classified information is not derivative classification.

(3) A source document that does not contain portion markings, due to an ISOO-approved waiver, must contain a warning statement that it may not be used as a source for derivative classification in accordance with 32 CFR 2001.24(k)(4).

(4) Classified information in email messages is marked pursuant to E.O. 13526 and 32 CFR part 2001. If an email is transmitted on a classified system, includes a classified attachment, and contains no classified information within the body of the email itself, the email serves as a transmittal document and is not a derivatively classified document. The email's overall classification must reflect the highest classification level present in the attachment.

(c) Derivative classification responsibilities. Contractors will provide employees with pertinent classification guidance to fulfill their derivative classification responsibilities. All contractor employees authorized to make derivative classification decisions will:

(1) Mark the face of each derivatively classified document with a classification authority block that includes the employee's name and position or personal identifier, the entity name, and when applicable, the division or the branch.

Figure 1 to Paragraph (c)(1) Example of Industry Classification Authority Block

UNCLASSIFIED: CLASSIFICATION MARKINGS FOR ILLUSTRATION PURPOSES ONLY

Classified by: John Doe, Security Specialist, Entity ABC Security Division
Derived From: SecDef Memo, dtd 20101024, Subj: ______
Declassify On: 20201024
(2) Observe and respect original classification decisions.

(3) Carry forward the pertinent classification markings to any newly created documents. For information derivatively classified based on multiple sources, the derivative classifier will carry forward:

(i) The date or event for declassification that corresponds to the longest period of classification among the sources.

(ii) A listing of the source materials.

(4) Be trained, in accordance with § 117.12(h), in the proper application of the derivative classification principles at least once every two years.

(5) Whenever possible, use a classified addendum if classified information constitutes a small portion of an otherwise unclassified document.

(d) Security classification guidance.

(1) Contractors should be aware the GCA will:

(i) Incorporate appropriate security requirement clauses in a classified contract, IFB, RFP, RFQ, or all solicitations leading to a classified contract.

(ii) Provide the contractor with the security classification guidance needed during performance of the contract.

(iii) Provide this guidance to the contractor in the contract security classification specification, or equivalent.

(2) The contract security classification specification, or equivalent, must identify the specific elements of classified information involved in the contract that require security protection.

(3) At the discretion of the CSA, contractors may, to the extent possible, advise and assist in the development and any updates to or any revisions to the contract security classification specification, or equivalent.

(4) The contractor will comply with all aspects of the classification guidance.

(i) Users of classification guides are encouraged to notify the originator of the guide when they acquire information that suggests the need for change in the instructions contained in the guide.

(ii) Classification guidance is the exclusive responsibility of the GCA, and the final determination of the appropriate classification for the information rests with that activity. The contract security classification specification, or equivalent, is a contractual specification necessary for the performance of a classified contract. Challenges to classification status are in paragraph (e) in this section.

(iii) If the contractor receives a classified contract without a contract security classification specification, or equivalent, the contractor will notify the GCA. If the GCA does not respond with the appropriate contract security classification specification, or equivalent, the contractor will notify the CSA.

(5) Upon completion of a classified contract, the contractor must return all USG provided or deliverable information to the custody of the USG.

(i) If the GCA does not advise to the contrary, the contractor may retain copies of the USG material for a period of two years following the completion of the contract. The contract security classification specification, or equivalent, will continue in effect for this two-year period.

(ii) If the GCA determines the contractor has a continuing need for the copies of the USG material beyond the two-year period, the GCA will issue a final contract security classification specification, or equivalent, for the classified contract and will include disposition instructions for the copies.

(e) Challenges to classification status.

(1) The contractor will address challenges to classification status with the GCA and request remedy when:

(i) Information is classified improperly or unnecessarily.

(ii) Current security considerations justify downgrading to a lower classification level or upgrading to a higher classification level.

(iii) Security classification guidance is not provided, improper or inadequate.

(2) If the GCA does not provide a remedy, and the contractor still believes that corrective action is required, the contractor will make a formal written challenge to the GCA. The challenge will include:

(i) A description sufficient to identify the issue.

(ii) The reasons why the contractor thinks that corrective action is required.

(iii) Recommendations for appropriate corrective action.

(3) The contractor will safeguard the information as required for its assigned or proposed level of classification, whichever is higher, until action is completed.

(4) If the contractor does not receive a written answer from the GCA within 60 days, the contractor will request assistance from the CSA. If the contractor does not receive a response from the GCA within 120 days, the contractor may appeal the challenge to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel through ISOO.

(5) The fact that a contractor has initiated such a challenge will not, in any way, serve as a basis for adverse action against the contractor by the USG. If a contractor believes that adverse action did result from a classification challenge, the contractor will promptly furnish full details to ISOO for resolution.

(f) Contractor developed information. Whenever a contractor develops an unsolicited proposal or originates information not in the performance of a classified contract, the provisions of this paragraph apply.

(1) If the information was previously identified as classified, it will be classified according to an appropriate classification guide, or source document, and appropriately marked.

(2) If the information was not previously classified, but the contractor believes the information may or should be classified, the contractor will:

(i) Protect the information as though classified at the appropriate level.

(ii) Submit the information to the agency that has an interest for a classification determination. In such cases, clearly mark the material “CLASSIFICATION DETERMINATION PENDING; Protect as either TOP SECRET, SECRET, or CONFIDENTIAL.” This marking will appear conspicuously at least once on the material but no further markings are necessary until a classification determination is received.

(iii) Not be precluded from marking such material as entity-private or entity-proprietary information, unless the material was based upon information obtained from prior deliverables to the USG or was developed from USG material.

(iv) Protect the information pending a final classification determination. The information may be CUI, if it is not classified. Only information that is owned by, produced by, produced for, or is under the control of the USG can be classified in accordance with E.O. 13526.

(3) To be eligible for classification:

(i) The information must incorporate classified information to which the contractor was given prior access.

(ii) The information must be partially or wholly owned by, produced by or for, or under the control of the USG.

(4) 10 CFR 1045.21 includes provisions for the DOE with regard to privately generated RD, whereby the DOE may classify such information in accordance with the AEA.

(g) Improperly released classified information appearing in public media. Improperly released classified information is not automatically declassified. When classified information has been improperly released, and even when that classified information has become publicly available, contractors will:

(1) Continue to protect the information at the appropriate classification level until formally advised to the contrary by the GCA.

(2) Bring any questions about the propriety of continued classification in these cases to the immediate attention of the GCA.

(3) Notify the applicable CSA if an employee downloads the improperly released classified information to determine how to resolve a data spill.

(h) Downgrading or declassifying classified information. Information is downgraded or declassified based on the loss of sensitivity of the information due to the passage of time or on occurrence of a specific event. Downgrading or declassifying actions constitute implementation of a directed action based on a review by either the OCA or the USG-designated classification authority. Declassification is not an approval for public disclosure.

(1) Downgrading. Contractors will refer information for classification or downgrade to the GCA based on the guidance provided in a contract security classification specification, or equivalent, or upon formal notification.

(2) Declassification. Contractors are not authorized to implement downgrading or declassification instructions even when the material is marked for automatic downgrading or declassification. If the material is marked for automatic declassification and the contractor notes that the date or event for the automatic declassification has occurred, the contractor will seek guidance from the GCA.

(i) RD, FRD, and TFNI. Protection requirements for RD, FRD, and TFNI are pursuant to § 117.23(e). Information about classification and declassification of RD, FRD, or TFNI documents is in § 117.23(e)(5).

§ 117.14 Marking requirements.
(a) Purpose for marking.

(1) Physically marking classified information with appropriate classification markings serves to warn and inform holders of the information of the degree of protection required. Other notations facilitate downgrading and declassification, and aid in derivative classification actions.

(2) Contractors will clearly mark all classified information and material to convey to the holder the level of classification assigned, the portions that contain or reveal classified information, the period of time protection is required, the identity (by name and position or personal identifier) of the classifier, the source(s) for derivative classification, and any other notations required for protection of the information.

(b) Marking guidance for classified information and material. Contractors will use the marking guidance conveyed in 32 CFR 2001.22 through 2001.26, and its companion document, ISOO booklet “Marking Classified National Security Information,” (available at: https://www.archives.gov/isoo/training/training-aids) or CSA specific provided guidance for marking derivatively classified information and material and as required by applicable security classification guide. The special requirements for marking documents containing RD, FRD, and TFNI are addressed in § 117.23.

(c) Marking guidance for CUI. Contractors will use marking guidance conveyed in 32 CFR 2002.20, the CUI Marking Handbook (available at: https://www.archives.gov/files/cui/documents/20161206-cui-marking-handbook-v1-1-20190524.pdf), and agency policy to mark CUI in accordance with contract requirements.

(d) Working papers. Working papers will be marked, destroyed, and retained in accordance with § 117.15(e)(3).

(e) Translations. The contractor will mark translations of U.S. classified information into a language other than English with the appropriate U.S. markings and the foreign language equivalent to show the United States as the country of origin.

(f) Marking wholly unclassified material. The contractor will not mark or stamp wholly UNCLASSIFIED material as UNCLASSIFIED unless it is essential to convey to a recipient of such material that:

(1) The material has been examined specifically with a view to impose a security classification and has been determined not to require classification by the GCA.

(2) The material has been reviewed and has been determined to no longer require classification and it has been declassified by the applicable GCA.

(g) Marking miscellaneous material. The contractor will:

(1) Handle miscellaneous material developed in connection with the handling, processing, production, storage, and utilization of classified information in a manner that ensures adequate protection of the classified information involved.

(2) Destroy the miscellaneous material at the earliest practical time, unless a requirement exists to retain such material. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, there is no requirement for the contractor to mark such material, but disposition and retention requirements in § 117.15(i) and (j) apply.

(h) Marking training material. The contractor will clearly mark unclassified documents or materials that are created to simulate or demonstrate classified documents or material to indicate the actual UNCLASSIFIED status of the information. For example, the contractor may use: MARKINGS ARE FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY, OTHERWISE UNCLASSIFIED or UNCLASSIFIED SAMPLE, or other similar marking.

(i) Downgrading or declassification actions. When a contractor removes documents or material that have been downgraded or declassified from storage for use or for transmittal outside the contractor location:

(1) The documents or material must be re-marked pursuant to paragraph (i)(1)(i) or (i)(1)(ii) in this section.

(i) Prior to taking any action to downgrade or declassify information, the contractor will seek guidance from the GCA. If the GCA approves such action, the contractor will cancel all old classification markings with the new markings substituted, whenever practical. For documents, at a minimum the outside of the front cover, the title page, the first page, and the outside of the back will reflect the new classification markings, or include the designation UNCLASSIFIED. The contractor will re-mark other material by the most practical method for the type of material involved to ensure that it is clear to the holder what level of classification is assigned to the material.

(ii) When the GCA notifies contractors of downgrading or declassification actions that are contrary to the markings shown on the material, the contractor will re-mark material to indicate the change and notify other holders if further dissemination was made. The contractor will mark the material to indicate the:

(A) Authority for the action.

(B) Date of the action.

(C) Identity and position of the individual taking the action.

(2) If the volume of material is such that prompt re-marking of each classified item cannot be accomplished without unduly interfering with operations, the contractor may attach a downgrading and declassification notice to the inside of the file drawers or other storage container instead of the re-marking otherwise required.

(3) When such documents or materials are withdrawn from the container solely for transfer to another container, or when the container is transferred from one place to another, the transfer may be made without re-marking if the notice is attached to the new container or remains with each shipment.

(4) For the purpose of paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) in this section, the contractor must include in the downgrading and declassification notice:

(i) The authority for the downgrading or declassification action.

(ii) The date of the action.

(iii) The storage container to which it applies.

(j) Upgrading action.

(1) When the contractor receives notice from the GCA to upgrade material to a higher level; for example, from CONFIDENTIAL to SECRET, the contractor will:

(i) Immediately enter the new markings on the material according to the notice to upgrade, and strike through all the superseded markings.

(ii) Enter the authority for and the date of the upgrading action on the material.

(iii) Ensure all records affected are stored at the appropriate level of security, including digital networks and systems. Upgrades requiring network or system adjustment will be coordinated with the GCA to mitigate or account for impact on the execution of the contract.

(2) The contractor will notify all holders to whom they disseminated the material. The contractor will not mark the notice as classified unless it contains additional information warranting classification.

(3) In the case of material which was inadvertently released as UNCLASSIFIED, the contractor will mark and protect the notice as classified at the CONFIDENTIAL level, unless it contains additional information warranting a higher classification. The contractor will cite the applicable Contract Security Classification Specification, or equivalent, or other classification guide on the “Derived From” line and mark the notice with an appropriate declassification instruction.

(k) Dissemination of improperly marked information. If the contractor inadvertently distributes classified material without the proper classification assigned to it, or without any markings to identify the material as classified, as appropriate, the contractor will:

(1) Determine whether all holders of the material are cleared and authorized access to it.

(2) If recipients are authorized persons, and the contractor disseminated the information through authorized channels, promptly provide written notice to all holders of the proper classification to be assigned. The contractor will also include the classification source as well as declassification instructions in the notification.

(3) Report compromises to the CSA in accordance with the provisions of § 117.8(d), if:

(i) Any of the recipients of the material are not authorized persons.

(ii) Any material cannot be accounted for.

(iii) The material was transmitted through unauthorized channels.

(l) Marking foreign government classified material. Foreign government classified information will retain its original classification markings or will be assigned a U.S. classification that provides a degree of protection at least equivalent to that required by the foreign government entity that furnished the information in accordance with 32 CFR 2001.54. The equivalent U.S. classification and the country of origin will be marked on the front and back in English.

(m) Foreign government restricted information and “in confidence” information.

(1) Some foreign governments have a fourth level of classification that does not correspond to an equivalent U.S. classification that is identified as RESTRICTED information. In many cases, security agreements require RESTRICTED information to be protected as U.S. CONFIDENTIAL information.

(2) Some foreign governments may have a category of unclassified information that is protected by law. This latter category is normally provided to other governments with the expectation that the information will be treated “In Confidence.” The foreign government or international organization must state that the information is provided in confidence and that it must be protected from release.

(i) 10 U.S.C. 130c protects information provided “In Confidence” by foreign governments which is not classified but meets special requirements.

(ii) This provision also applies to RESTRICTED information which is not required by an agreement to be protected as classified information.

(iii) The contractor will not disclose information protected by this statutory provision to anyone except personnel who require access to the information in connection with the contract.

(3) It is the responsibility of the foreign entity that awards the contract to incorporate requirements for the protection and marking of RESTRICTED or “In Confidence” information in the contract. The contractor will advise the CSA if requirements were not provided by the foreign entity.

(n) Marking U.S. documents containing FGI.

(1) U.S. documents containing FGI must be marked on the front, “THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS (indicate country of origin) INFORMATION.” In addition, the portions must be marked to identify both the country and classification level, (e.g., (UK-C), (GE-C)). The “Derived From” line will identify U.S. as well as foreign classification sources.

(2) If the identity of the foreign government must be concealed, the front of the document will be marked “THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS FOREIGN GOVERNMENT INFORMATION;” paragraphs will be marked FGI, together with the classification level (e.g., (FGI-C)); and the “Derived From” line will indicate FGI in addition to any U.S. source. The identity of the foreign government will be maintained with the record copy of the document.

(3) A U.S. document that contains FGI will not be downgraded below the highest level of FGI contained in the document or be declassified without the written approval of the foreign government that originated the information. Recommendations concerning downgrading or declassification will be submitted to the GCA or foreign government contracting authority, as applicable.

(o) Marking documents prepared for foreign governments. Documents prepared for foreign governments that contain U.S. classified information and FGI will be marked as prescribed by the foreign government. In addition, they will be marked on the front, “THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS UNITED STATES CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.” Portions will be marked to identify the U.S. classified information.

(p) Marking requirements for transfers of defense articles to Australia (AUS) or the United Kingdom (UK). Marking requirements for transfers of defense articles to AUS or the UK without a license or other written authorization are pursuant to § 117.19(i).

(q) Commingling of RD and FRD. Commingling of RD, FRD, and TFNI with national security information (NSI) in the same document should be avoided to the greatest degree possible. When mixing this information cannot be avoided, the marking requirements in 10 CFR part 1045, section 140(f) and declassification requirements of 10 CFR part 1045, section 155 apply.

§ 117.15 Safeguarding classified information.
(a) General safeguarding. Contractors will be responsible for safeguarding classified information in their custody or under their control, with approval for such storage of classified information by the applicable CSA. Individuals are responsible for safeguarding classified information entrusted to them. Contractors will provide the extent of protection to classified information sufficient to reasonably protect it from loss or compromise.

(1) Oral discussions. Contractors will ensure that all cleared personnel are aware of the prohibition against discussing classified information over unsecured telephones, in public conveyances or places, or in any other manner that permits interception by unauthorized persons.

(2) End of day security checks.

(i) Contractors that store classified material will establish a system of security checks at the close of each working day to verify that all classified material and security repositories have been appropriately secured.

(ii) Contractors that operate multiple work shifts will perform the security checks at the end of the last working shift in which classified material was removed from storage for use. The checks are not required during continuous 24-hour operations.

(3) Perimeter controls.

(i) Contractors authorized to store classified material will establish and maintain a system to deter and detect unauthorized introduction or removal of classified material from their facility without proper authority.

(ii) If the unauthorized introduction or removal of classified material can be reasonably prevented through technical means (e.g., an intrusion detection system), which are encouraged, no further controls are necessary. The contractor will provide appropriate authorization to personnel who have a legitimate need to remove or transport classified material for passing through designated entry or exit points.

(iii) The contractor will:

(A) Provide appropriate authorization to personnel who have a legitimate need to remove or transport classified material for passing through designated entry or exit points.

(B) Conspicuously post notices at all pertinent entries and exits that persons who enter or depart the facility are subject to an inspection of their personal, except under circumstances where the possibility of access to classified material is remote.

(C) Limit inspections to buildings or areas where classified work is being performed.

(D) Establish the extent, frequency, and location of inspections in a manner consistent with contractual obligations and operational efficiency. The contractor may use any appropriate random sampling technique.

(E) Seek legal advice during the formulation of implementing procedures.

(F) Submit significant problems pertaining to perimeter controls and inspections to the CSA.

(iv) Contractors will develop procedures for safeguarding classified material in emergency situations.

(A) The procedures should be as simple and practical as possible and adaptable to any type of emergency that may reasonably arise.

(B) Contractors will promptly report to the CSA any emergency situation that renders them incapable of safeguarding classified material.

(b) Standards for Security Equipment. Contractors will follow guidelines established in 32 CFR part 2001, when procuring storage and destruction equipment. Authorized repairs for GSA-approved security containers and vaults must be in accordance with Federal Standard 809.

(c) Storage. Contractors will store classified information and material in General Services Administration (GSA)-approved security containers, vaults built to Federal Standard 832, or an open storage area constructed in accordance with 32 CFR 2001.53. In the instance that an open storage area has a false ceiling or raised floor, contractors shall develop and implement procedures to ensure their structural integrity. Nothing in 32 CFR part 2001, should be construed to contradict or inhibit compliance with local laws or building codes, but the contractor will notify the applicable CSA if there are any conflicting issues that would inhibit compliance. Contractors will store classified material in accordance with the specific sections of 32 CFR 2001.43:

(1) CONFIDENTIAL. See 32 CFR 2001.43(b)(3).

(2) SECRET. See 32 CFR 2001.43(b)(2).

(3) TOP SECRET Documents. See 32 CFR 2001.43(b)(1).

(d) Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). This paragraph specifies the minimum standards for an approved IDS when used for supplemental protection of TOP SECRET and SECRET material. The CSA will provide additional guidance for contingency protection procedures in the event of IDS malfunction, including contractors located in USG owned contractor operated facilities.

(1) CSA approval.

(i) CSA approval is required before installing an IDS. The CSA will base approval of a new IDS on the criteria of Intelligence Community Directive 705 (available at: https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD_705_SCIFs.pdf) and any applicable intelligence community standard, Underwriters Laboratories (UL) Standard 2050 (Government agencies with a role as a CSA or CSO may obtain this reference without charge; available at: www.ul.com/contact), or the CSA may base approval on written CSA-specific standards for the information to be protected.

(ii) Installation will be performed by an alarm services company certified by a NRTL that meets the requirements in 29 CFR 1910.7 to perform testing and certification. The NRTL-approved alarm service company is responsible for completing the appropriate alarm system description form approved by the NRTL.

(iii) All the intrusion detection equipment (IDE) used in the IDS installation will be tested and approved (or listed) by a NRTL, ensuring its proper operation and resistance from tampering. Any IDE that has not been tested and approved by a NRTL will require CSA approval.

(2) Central monitoring station.

(i) For the purpose of monitoring alarms, an equivalent level of monitoring service is available from multiple types of providers. The central monitoring station may be located at a one of the following:

(A) Government contractor monitoring station (GCMS), formerly called a proprietary central station.

(B) Cleared commercial central station.

(C) Cleared protective signal service station (e.g., fire alarm monitor).

(D) Cleared residential monitoring station.

(E) National industrial monitoring station.

(ii) SECRET-cleared central station employees at the alarm monitoring station will be in attendance in sufficient number to monitor each alarmed area within the cleared contractor facility.

(iii) The central monitoring station will be supervised continuously by a U.S. citizen who has eligibility for access to SECRET information.

(iv) The IDS must be activated at the close of business whenever the area is not occupied by cleared personnel. Any IDS exit delay function must expire prior to the cleared personnel leaving the immediate area. A record will be maintained to identify the person or persons who are responsible for setting and deactivating the IDS.

(v) Records will be maintained for 12 months indicating time of receipt of alarm, name(s) of security force personnel responding, time dispatched to facility or area, time security force personnel arrived, nature of alarm, and what follow-up actions were accomplished.

(3) Investigative response to alarms.

(i) Alarm response teams will ascertain if intrusion has occurred and, if possible, assist in the apprehension of the individuals involved.

(A) If an alarm activation resets in a reasonable amount of time and no damage to the area is visible, then entrance into the area is not required and an initial response team may consist of uncleared personnel.

(B) If the alarm activation does not reset and damage is observed, then a cleared response team must be dispatched. The initial uncleared response team must stay on station until relieved by the cleared response team. If a cleared response team does not arrive within 1 hour, then a report to the CSA must be made by the close of the next business day.

(ii) The following resources may be used to investigate alarms: Proprietary security force personnel, central station guards, local law enforcement personnel, or a subcontracted guard service. The CSA may approve procedures for the use of entity cleared employees who can meet the minimum response requirements outlined in this section.

(A) For a GCMS, trained proprietary or subcontractor security force personnel, cleared to the SECRET level and sufficient in number to be dispatched immediately to investigate each alarm, will be available at all times when the IDS is in operation.

(B) For a commercial central station, protective signaling service station, or residential monitoring station, there will be a sufficient number of trained guards available to respond to alarms. Guards will be cleared only if they have the ability and responsibility to access the area or container(s) housing classified material (i.e., keys to the facility have been provided or the personnel are authorized to enter the building or check the container or area that contains classified material).

(C) Uncleared guards dispatched by a commercial central station, protective signaling service station, or residential monitoring station in response to an alarm will remain on the premises until a designated, cleared representative of the facility arrives, or for a period of not less than 1 hour, whichever comes first. If a cleared representative of the facility does not arrive within 1 hour following the arrival of the guard, the central control station must provide the CSA with a report of the incident that includes the name of the subscriber facility, the date and time of the alarm, and the name of the subscriber's representative who was contacted to respond. A report will be submitted to the CSA by the end of business on the next business day.

(D) Subcontracted guards must be under a classified contract with either the installing alarm service company or the cleared facility.

(iii) The response time will be in accordance with the provisions in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) in this section as applicable. When environmental factors (e.g., traffic, distance) legitimately prevent meeting the requirements for TOP SECRET information, as indicated in paragraph (c)(3) in this section, the CSA may authorize up to a 30-minute response time. The CSA approval will be documented on the alarm system description form and the specified response time will be noted on the alarm certificate. The requirement for response is 80 percent within the time limits.

(4) Installation. The IDS will be installed by an NRTL-approved entity or by an entity approved in writing by the CSA. When connected to a commercial central station, GCMS, national industrial monitoring station, or residential monitoring station, the service provided will include line security (i.e., the connecting lines are electronically supervised to detect evidence of tampering or malfunction). The level of protection for the alarmed area will include all points of probable entry (perimeter doors and accessible windows) with magnetic contacts and motion detectors positioned in the probable intruder paths from the probable points of entry to the classified information. In accordance with Federal Standard 809, no IDS sensors (magnetic contacts or vibration detectors) will be installed on GSA-approved security containers. CSA authorization on the alarm system description form is required in the following circumstances:

(i) When line security is not available, installation will require two independent means of transmission of the alarm signal from the alarmed area to the monitoring station.

(ii) Alarm installation provides a level of protection, e.g. UL's Extent 5, based on patrolling employees and CSA approval of security-in-depth.

(iii) Where law enforcement personnel are the primary alarm response. Under those circumstances, the contractor must obtain written assurance from the police department regarding the ability to respond to alarms in the required response time.

(iv) Alarm signal transmission is over computer-controlled data-networks (e.g., internet, intranet). The CSA will provide specific acceptance criteria (e.g., encryption requirements) for alarms monitored over data networks.

(v) Alarm investigator response time exceeds the parameters outlined in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) in this section as applicable.

(5) Certification of compliance. Evidence of compliance with the requirements of this section will consist of a valid (current) certification by an approved NRTL for the appropriate category of service. This certificate:

(i) Will have been issued to the protected facility by the NRTL, through the alarm service company.

(ii) Serves as evidence that the alarm service company that did the installation is:

(A) Listed as furnishing security systems of the category indicated.

(B) Authorized to issue the certificate of installation as representation that the equipment is in compliance with requirements established by NRTL for the class of alarm system.

(C) Subject to the NRTL inspection program whereby periodic inspections are made of representative alarm installations by NRTL personnel to verify the correctness of certification practices.

(6) Exceptional cases.

(i) If the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(5) in this section cannot be met, the contractor may request CSA approval for an alarm system meeting one of these conditions, which will be documented on the alarm system description form:

(A) Monitored by a central control station but responded to by a local (municipal, county, state) law enforcement organization.

(B) Connected by direct wire to alarm receiving equipment located in a local (municipal, county, State) police station or public emergency service dispatch center. This alarm system is activated and deactivated by employees of the contractor, but the alarm is monitored and responded to by personnel of the monitoring police or emergency service dispatch organization. Personnel monitoring alarm signals at police stations or dispatch centers do not require PCLs. Police department response systems may be requested only when:

(1) The contractor facility is located in an area where central control station services are not available with line security or proprietary security force personnel, or a contractually-dispatched response to an alarm signal cannot be achieved within the time limits required by the CSA.

(2) It is impractical for the contractor to establish a GCMS or proprietary guard force at that location. In this case, installation of these systems must use NRTL-approved equipment and be accomplished by an NRTL-approved entity meeting the applicable testing standard for the category of service.

(ii) An installation proposal, explaining how the system would operate, will be submitted to the CSA. The proposal must include:

(A) Sufficient justification for the granting of an exception and the full name and address of the police department that will monitor the system and provide the required response.

(B) The name and address of the NRTL-approved entity that will install the system, and inspect, maintain, and repair the equipment.

(iii) The response times will be in accordance with the provisions in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) in this section as applicable. Arrangements will be made with the central monitoring station to immediately notify a contractor representative on receipt of the alarm. The contractor representative is required to go immediately to the facility to investigate the alarm and to take appropriate measures to secure the classified material.

(iv) In exceptional cases where central station monitoring service is available, but no proprietary security force, central station, or subcontracted guard response is available, and where the police department does not agree to respond to alarms, and no other manner of investigative response is available, the CSA may approve cleared employees as the sole means of response.

(e) Information controls —

(1) Information management system. Contractors will establish:

(i) A system to verify that classified information in their custody is used or retained only for a lawful and authorized USG purpose.

(ii) An information management system to protect and control the classified information in their possession regardless of media, to include information processed and stored on authorized information systems.

(2) Top secret information. Contractors will establish controls for TOP SECRET information and material to validate procedures are in place to address accountability, need to know, and retention, e.g., demonstrating that TOP SECRET material stored in an electronic format on an authorized classified information system does not need to be individually numbered in series. These controls are in addition to the information management system and must be applied, unless otherwise directed by the applicable CSA, regardless of the media of the TOP SECRET information, to include information processed and stored on authorized information systems. Unless otherwise directed by the applicable CSA, the contractor will establish the following additional controls:

(i) Designate TOP SECRET control officials to receive, transmit, and maintain access and accountability records to TOP SECRET information.

(ii) Conduct an annual inventory of TOP SECRET information and material.

(iii) Establish a continuous receipt system for the transmittal of TOP SECRET information within and outside the contractor location.

(3) Working papers. Contractors will establish procedures for the control of classified working papers generated in the preparation of a finished document. The contractor will:

(i) Date working papers when they are created.

(ii) Mark each page of the working papers with the highest classification level of any information contained in them and with the annotation “WORKING PAPERS.”

(iii) Destroy working papers when no longer needed.

(iv) Mark in the same manner prescribed for a finished document at the same classification level if released outside the contractor location or retained for more than 180 days from the date of origin.

(4) Combinations to locks. Contractors will follow the guidance in 32 CFR 2001.45(a)(1) and 2001.43 (c) to address thresholds when combinations will be changed. Combinations to locks used to secure vaults, open storage areas, and security containers that are approved for the safeguarding of classified information will be protected in the same manner as the highest level of classified information that the vault, open storage area, or security container is used to protect.

(5) Information system passwords. Contractors will follow the guidance established in 32 CFR 2001.45(a)(2) for the protection of passwords to information systems authorized to process and store classified information at the highest level of classification to which the information system is authorized.

(6) Reproduction of classified information. Contractors will follow the guidance established in 32 CFR 2001.45(b) for the reproduction of classified information.

(f) Transmission of classified information. Contractors will establish procedures for transmitting and receiving classified information and material in accordance with 32 CFR 2001.46.

(2) Transmission outside the United States and its Territorial Areas. The contractor may transmit classified material to a USG activity outside the United States or a U.S. territorial area only under the provisions of a classified contract or with written authorization from the GCA.

(3) Commercial delivery entities. The CSA may approve contractors to transmit SECRET or CONFIDENTIAL information within the United States and its territorial areas by means of a commercial delivery entity that is a current holder of the GSA contract for overnight delivery, and which provides nation-wide, overnight service with computer tracking and reporting features (a list of current contract holders may be found at: https://www.archives.gov/isoo/faqs#what-is-overnightcarriers). Such entities do not need to be determined eligible for access to classified information.

(i) Prior to CSA approval, the contractor must establish and document procedures to ensure the proper protection of incoming and outgoing classified packages, including the street delivery address, for each cleared facility intending to use GSA-listed commercial delivery entities for overnight services.

(ii) Contractors will establish procedures for the use of commercial delivery entities in accordance with 32 CFR part 2001. The procedures will:

(A) Confirm that the commercial delivery entity provides nationwide, overnight delivery service with automated in-transit tracking of the classified packages.

(B) Ensure the package integrity during transit and that incoming shipments are received by appropriately cleared personnel.

(C) Not be used for COMSEC, NATO, or FGI.

(5) Use of commercial passenger aircraft. The contractor may authorize cleared employees to hand carry classified material aboard commercial passenger aircraft.

(i) Routine processing. Employees hand carrying classified material are subject to routine processing by airline security agents. Hand-held packages will normally be screened by x-ray examination. If security personnel are not satisfied with the results of the inspection and requests the prospective passenger to open a classified package for visual examination, the traveler must inform the screener that the carry-on items contain USG classified information and cannot be opened. Under no circumstances may traveler or security personnel open the classified material unless required by customs or other government officials.

(ii) Special processing. The contractor will contact the appropriate air carrier in advance to explain the particular circumstances and obtain instructions on the special screening procedures to follow when:

(A) Routine processing would subject the classified material to compromise or damage.

(B) Visual examination is or may be required to successfully screen a classified package.

(C) Classified material is in specialized containers, which due to its size, weight, or other physical characteristics cannot be routinely processed.

(iii) Authorization letter. Contractors will provide employees with written authorization to hand carry classified material on commercial aircraft that includes:

(A) Full name, date of birth, height, weight, and signature of the traveler and statement that he or she is authorized to transmit classified material.

(B) Description of the type of identification the traveler will present on request.

(C) Description of the material being hand carried, with a request that it be exempt from opening.

(D) Identification of the points of departure, destination, and known transfer points.

(E) Name, telephone number, and signature of the FSO, and the location and telephone number of the CSA.

(6) Escorts.

(2) If the GCA does not authorize retention beyond two years, the contractor will destroy all classified material received or generated in the performance of a classified contract unless it has been declassified or the GCA has requested that the material be returned.

(k) Termination of security agreement. Notwithstanding the provisions for retention outlined in paragraph (i) in this section, in the event that the CSA terminates the contractor's eligibility for access to classified information, the contractor will return all classified material in its possession to the GCA concerned, or dispose of such material in accordance with instructions from the CSA.

(l) Safeguarding CUI. While outside the requirements of the NISPOM, when a classified contract also includes provisions for protection of CUI, contractors will comply with those contract requirements.

§ 117.16 Visits and meetings.
(a) Visits. This paragraph applies when, for a lawful and authorized USG purpose, it is anticipated that classified information will be disclosed during a visit to a cleared contractor facility or to a USG facility.

(1) Classified visits. The number of classified visits will be held to a minimum. The contractor:

(i) Must determine that the visit is necessary and the purpose of the visit cannot be achieved without access to, or disclosure of, classified information.

(ii) Will establish procedures to ensure positive identification of visitors, appropriate PCL, and need-to-know prior to the disclosure of any classified information.

(iii) Will establish procedures to ensure that visitors are only afforded access to classified information consistent with the purpose of the visit.

(2) Need-to-know determination. The responsibility for determining need-to-know in connection with a classified visit rests with the individual who will disclose classified information during the visit. Need-to-know is generally based on a contractual relationship between the contractors. In other circumstances, disclosure of the information will be based on an assessment that the receiving contractor has a bona fide need to access the information in furtherance of a GCA purpose.

(3) Visits by USG representatives. Representatives of the USG, when acting in their official capacities as inspectors, investigators, or auditors, may visit a contractor's facility, provided these representatives present appropriate USG credentials upon arrival.

(4) Visit authorization.

(i) If a visit requires access to classified information, the host contractor will verify the visitor's PCL level. Verification of a visitor's PCL may be accomplished by a review of a CSA-designated database that contains the information or by a visit authorization letter (VAL) provided by the visitor's employer.

(ii) If a CSA-designated database is not available and a VAL is required, contractors will include in all VALs:

(A) Contractor's name, employee's name, address, and telephone number, assigned commercial and government entity (CAGE) code, if applicable, and certification of the level of the entity eligibility determination.

(B) Name, date and place of birth, and citizenship of the employee intending to visit.

(C) Certification of the proposed visitor's PCL and any special access authorizations required for the visit.

(D) Name of person(s) to be visited.

(E) Purpose and sufficient justification for the visit to allow for a determination of the necessity of the visit.

(F) Date or period during which the VAL is to be valid.

(5) Long term visitors.

(i) When USG employees or employees of one contractor are temporarily stationed at another contractor's facility, the security procedures of the host contractor will govern.

(ii) USG personnel assigned to or visiting a contractor facility and engaged in oversight of an acquisition program will retain control of their work product. Classified work products of USG employees will be handled in accordance with this rule. Contractor procedures will not require USG employees to relinquish control of their work products, whether classified or not, to a contractor.

(iii) Contractor employees at USG installations will follow the security requirements of the host. This does not relieve the contractor from security oversight of their employees who are long-term visitors at USG installations.

(b) Classified meetings. This paragraph applies to a conference, seminar, symposium, exhibit, convention, training course, or other such gathering during which classified information is disclosed, hereafter called a “meeting.” Disclosure of classified information to large diverse audiences such as conferences increases security risks. Classified disclosure at such meetings may occur when it serves a government purpose and adequate security measures have been provided in advance.

(1) Meeting conducted by a cleared contractor. If conducted by a cleared contractor, the meeting is authorized by a USG agency that has agreed to assume security jurisdiction. The USG agency:

(i) Must approve security arrangements, announcements, attendees, and the location of the meeting.

(ii) May delegate certain responsibilities to a cleared contractor for the security arrangements and other actions necessary for the meeting under the general supervision of the USG agency.

(2) Request for authorization. Contractors desiring to conduct meetings that require sponsorship will submit their requests to the USG agency that has principal interest in the subject of each meeting. Requests for authorization will include:

(i) An explanation of the USG purpose to be served by disclosing classified information at the meeting and why the use of conventional channels for release of the classified information will not advance those interests.

(ii) The subject of the meeting and scope of classified topics, to include the classification level, to be disclosed at the meeting.

(iii) The expected dates and location of the meeting.

(iv) The general content of the proposed announcement or invitation to be sent to prospective attendees or participants.

(v) The identity of any other non-government organization involved and a full description of the type of support it will provide.

(vi) A list of any foreign representatives (including their nationality, name, organizational affiliation) whose attendance at the meeting is proposed.

(vii) A description of the security arrangements necessary for the meeting to comply with the requirements of this rule.

(3) Locations of meetings. Classified sessions will be held only at a USG installation or a cleared contractor facility where adequate physical security and procedural controls have been approved. The authorizing USG agency is responsible for evaluating and approving the location proposed for the meeting.

(4) Security arrangements for meetings. The contractor will develop the security measures and procedures to be used and obtain the authorizing agency's approval. The security arrangements must provide:

(i) Announcements. Approval of the authorizing agency will be obtained for all announcements of the meeting.

(A) Announcements will be unclassified and will be limited to a general description of topics expected to be presented, names of speakers, and administrative instructions for requesting invitations or participation. Classified presentations will not be solicited in the announcement.

(B) When the meeting has been approved, announcements may only state that the USG agency has authorized the conduct of classified sessions and will provide necessary security assistance.

(C) The announcement will further specify that security clearances and justification to attend classified sessions are to be forwarded to the authorizing agency or its designee.

(D) Invitations to foreign persons will be sent by the authorizing USG agency.

(ii) Clearance and need-to-know. All persons in attendance at classified sessions will possess the requisite clearance and need-to-know for the information to be disclosed.

(A) Need-to-know will be determined by the authorizing agency or its designee based on the justification provided.

(B) Attendance will be authorized only to those persons whose security clearance and justification for attendance have been verified by the security officer of the organization represented.

(C) The names of all authorized attendees or participants must appear on an access list with entry permitted to the classified session only after verification of the attendee's identity based on presentation of official photographic identification such as a passport, contractor or USG identification card.

(iii) Presentations. Classified information must be authorized for disclosure in advance by the USG agency having jurisdiction over the information to be presented.

(A) Individuals making presentations at meetings will provide sufficient classification guidance to enable attendees to identify what information is classified and the level of classification.

(B) Classified presentations will be delivered orally or visually.

(C) Copies of classified presentation materials will not be distributed at the classified meeting, and any classified notes or electronic recordings of classified presentations will be classified, safeguarded, and transmitted as required by this rule.

(iv) Physical security. The physical security measures for the classified sessions will provide for control of, access to, and dissemination of, the classified information to be presented and will provide for secure storage capability, if necessary.

(5) Disclosure authority at meetings. Authority to disclose classified information at meetings, whether disclosure is by officials of industry or USG, must be granted by the USG agency or activity that has classification jurisdiction over the information to be disclosed. Each contractor that desires to disclose classified information at a meeting is responsible for requesting and obtaining disclosure approvals. Associations are not responsible for ensuring that classified presentations and papers of other organizations have been approved for disclosure. A contractor desiring to disclose classified information at a meeting will:

(i) Obtain prior written authorization for each proposed disclosure of classified information from the USG agency having jurisdiction over the information involved.

(ii) Furnish a copy of the disclosure authorization to the USG agency sponsoring the meeting.

(6) Requests to attend classified meetings. Before a contractor employee can attend a classified meeting, the contractor will provide justification for why the employee requires access to the classified information, cite the classified contract or GCA program or project involved, and forward the information to the authorizing USG agency.

§ 117.17 Subcontracting.
(a) Prime contractor responsibilities —

(1) Responsibilities. Before a prime contractor may release or disclose classified information to a subcontractor, or cause classified information to be generated by a subcontractor, a determination that access to classified information will be required and such access serves a legitimate USG requirement for the performance of a “classified contract” in accordance with § 117.9(a) must be made. Prime contractors are responsible for communicating the appropriate security requirements to all subcontractors.

(i) A “security requirements clause” and a “Contract Security Classification Specification,” or equivalent, will be incorporated in the solicitation and in the subcontract. (See the “security requirements clause” in the prime contract.)

(ii) The subcontractor must possess an appropriate entity eligibility determination and a classified information safeguarding capability if possession of classified information will be required.

(A) If access to classified information will not be required in the pre-award phase, prospective subcontractors are not required to possess an entity eligibility determination to receive or bid on the solicitation.

(B) If a prospective subcontractor requires access to classified information during the pre-award phase and does not have the appropriate entity eligibility determination or a classified information safeguarding capability, the prime contractor will request the CSA of the subcontractor to initiate the necessary action.

(iii) If access to classified information will not be required, the contract is not a classified contract within the meaning of this rule. If the prime contract contains requirements for release or disclosure of protected information that is not classified, such as CUI, the requirements will be incorporated in the solicitation and the subcontract and are not covered by this rule.

(2) Prospective subcontractors entity eligibility determinations.

(i) The prime contractor will verify whether the prospective subcontractors have the appropriate entity eligibility determination and also a classified information safeguarding capability, if a subcontract requirement. This determination can be made if there is an existing contractual relationship between the parties involving classified information of the same or higher category, and must be verified by accessing the CSA-designated database, or by contacting the CSA.

(ii) If a prospective subcontractor does not have the appropriate entity eligibility determination or a classified information safeguarding capability, the prime contractor will request that the CSA of the subcontractor initiate the necessary action.

(A) Requests will include, at a minimum, the full name, address, and contact information for the requester; the full name, address, and contact information for a contact at the facility to be processed for an entity eligibility determination; the level of clearance and the required classified information safeguarding capability; and full justification for the request.

(B) Requests for safeguarding capability will include a description, quantity, end-item, and classification of the information related to the proposed subcontract.

(C) Other factors necessary to help the CSA determine if the prospective subcontractor meets the requirements of this rule will be identified, such as any special access requirements.

(3) Lead time for entity eligibility determination when awarding to an uncleared subcontractor. Requesting contractors will allow sufficient lead time in connection with the award of a classified subcontract to enable an uncleared bidder to be processed for the necessary entity eligibility determination. When the entity eligibility determination cannot be granted in sufficient time to qualify the prospective subcontractor for participation in the current procurement action, the CSA will continue the entity eligibility determination processing action to qualify the prospective subcontractor for future contract consideration provided:

(i) The delay in processing the entity eligibility determination was not caused by a lack of cooperation on the part of the prospective subcontractor.

(ii) Future classified negotiations may occur within 12 months.

(iii) There is reasonable likelihood the subcontractor may be awarded a classified subcontract.

(iv) Subcontracting that involves access to FGI.

(A) A U.S. contractor may award a subcontract that involves access to FGI to another U.S. contractor after verifying with the CSA that the prospective subcontractor has the appropriate entity eligibility determination and a classified information storage capability, and review of the prime contract to determine if there are any contractual limitations for approval before awarding a subcontract. The contractor awarding a subcontract will provide appropriate security classification guidance and incorporate the pertinent security provisions in the subcontract.

(B) The contractor cannot award subcontracts involving FGI to a contractor in a third country or to a U.S. entity with a limited entity eligibility determination based on third-country FOCI without the express written consent of the originating foreign government. The CSA will coordinate with the appropriate foreign government authorities.

(b) Security classification guidance.

(1) Prime contractors will ensure that a Contract Security Classification Specification, or equivalent, is incorporated in each classified subcontract.

(i) When preparing classification guidance for a subcontract, the prime contractor may extract pertinent information from:

(A) The Contract Security Classification Specification, or equivalent, issued with the prime contract.

(B) Security classification guides issued with the prime contract.

(C) Any security guides that provide guidance for the classified information furnished to, or that will be generated by, the subcontractor.

(ii) The Contract Security Classification Specification, or equivalent, prepared by the prime contractor will be certified by a designated official of the contractor.

(iii) In the absence of exceptional circumstances, the classification specification will not contain any classified information. If classified supplements are required as part of the Contract Security Classification Specification, or equivalent, they will be identified and forwarded to the subcontractor by separate correspondence.

(2) An original Contract Security Classification Specification, or equivalent, will be included with each RFQ, RFP, IFB, or other solicitation to ensure that the prospective subcontractor is aware of the security requirements of the subcontract and can plan accordingly. An original Contract Security Classification Specification, or equivalent, will also be included in the subcontract awarded to the successful bidder.

(3) A revised Contract Security Classification Specification, or equivalent, will be issued as necessary during the lifetime of the subcontract when the security requirements change.

(4) Requests for public release by a subcontractor will be forwarded through the prime contractor to the GCA.

(c) Responsibilities upon completion of the subcontracts.

(1) Upon completion of the subcontract, the subcontractor may retain classified material received or generated under the subcontract for a two-year period, in accordance with the provisions in § 117.13(d)(5).

(2) If retention is required beyond the two-year period, the subcontractor must request written retention authority through the prime contractor to the GCA, including the information required by § 117.15(j).

(3) If retention authority is approved by the GCA, the prime contractor will issue a final Contract Security Classification Specification, or equivalent, annotated to provide the retention period and final disposition instructions.

(d) Notification of invalidation, marginal, or unsatisfactory conditions. The prime contractor will be notified if the CSA discovers marginal or unsatisfactory conditions at the subcontractor's facility or if the CSA invalidates the subcontractor's facility clearance. Once notified, the prime contractor will follow the instructions received on what action, if any, should be taken in order to safeguard classified material relating to the subcontract.

§ 117.18 Information system security.
(a) General.

(1) Contractor information systems that are used to capture, create, store, process, or distribute classified information must be properly managed to protect against unauthorized disclosure of classified information. The contractor will implement protective measures using a risk-based approach that incorporates minimum standards for their insider threat program in accordance with CSA-provided guidance.

(2) The CSA will issue guidance based on requirements for federal systems, pursuant to 44 U.S.C. Ch. 35 of subchapter II, also known as the “Federal Information Security Modernization Act,” and as set forth in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-37 (available at: https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-37/rev-2/final), Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) Instruction 1253 (available at: https://www.cnss.gov/CNSS/openDoc.cfm?QwPYrAJ5Ldq+s+jvttTznQ==), and other applicable CNSS and NIST publications (e.g., NIST Special Publication 800-53).

(v) Be subject to monitoring of their activity on any classified network, understanding that the results of such monitoring can be used against them in a criminal, security, or administrative proceeding or action.

(vi) Notify the ISSM or ISSO when access to a classified system is no longer required.

(d) Information system security life-cycle. The CSA-provided guidance on the information system security life-cycle is based on the risk management framework outlined in NIST special publication 800-37 that emphasizes:

(1) Building security into information systems during initial development.

(2) Maintaining continuous awareness of the current state of information system security.

(3) Keeping contractor management informed to facilitate risk management decisions.

(4) Supporting reciprocity of information system authorizations.

(e) Risk management framework. The risk management framework is a seven-step process used for managing information system security-related risks. These steps will be used to help ensure security capabilities provided by the selected security controls are implemented, tested, validated, and approved by the USG authorizing official with a degree of assurance appropriate for the information system. This process accommodates an on-going risk mitigation strategy.

(1) Prepare. The contractor will execute essential activities at the organization, mission and business process, and system levels of the organization to help prepare the organization to manage its security and privacy risks using the Risk Management Framework.

(2) Categorize. The contractor will categorize the information system and the information processed, stored, and transmitted by the information system based on an impact analysis. Unless imposed by contract, the information system baseline is moderate-confidentiality, low-integrity, and low-availability.

(3) Select. The contractor will select an initial set of baseline security controls for the information system based on the security categorization; tailoring and supplementing the security control baseline as needed based on an organizational assessment of risk and local conditions.

(4) Implement. The contractor will implement the security controls and document how the controls are deployed within the information system and the operational environment.

(5) Assess. The contractor will assess the security controls to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the information system. The contractor will review and certify to the CSA that all systems have the appropriate protection measures in place.

(6) Authorize. The CSA will use the information provided by the contractor to make a timely, credible, and risk-based decision to authorize the system to process classified information. The CSA must authorize the system before the contractor can use the system to process classified information.

(7) Monitor. The contractor will monitor and assess selected security controls in the information system on an ongoing basis:

(i) Effectiveness of security controls.

(ii) Documentation of changes to the information system and the operational environment.

(iii) Analysis of the security impact of changes to the information system.

§ 117.19 International security requirements.
(a) General. This section provides information and procedures governing the protection of classified information in international programs.

(b) Disclosure of classified U.S. information to foreign interests —

(1) Applicable federal law. The transfer of articles, services, and related data to a foreign person, within or outside the United States, or the movement of such material or information to any destination outside of the legal jurisdiction of the United States constitutes an export. Depending on the nature of the articles or data, most exports are pursuant to (1) 22 U.S.C. chapter 39, also known and referred to in this rule as the “Arms Export Control Act,” (2) 50 U.S.C. 4801 et seq., also known as the “Export Control Reform Act of 2018,” or (3) the AEA. This section applies to those exports that involve classified information.

(2) Security agreements —

(i) Bilateral security agreements (e.g., General Security of Information Agreements and General Security of Military Information Agreements) are negotiated with various foreign governments. Confidentiality requested by some foreign governments prevents a listing of the countries that have executed these agreements. The bilateral security agreement, negotiated through diplomatic channels:

(A) Requires that each government provide substantially the same degree of protection to classified information released by the other government.

(B) Contains provisions concerning limits on the use of each government's information, including restrictions on third-party transfers and proprietary rights.

(C) Does not commit governments to share classified information, nor does it constitute authority to release classified material to that government.

(D) Satisfies, in part, the eligibility requirements of the Arms Export Control Act concerning the agreement of the recipient foreign government to protect U.S. classified defense articles and classified information.

(ii) The applicable CSA will provide a mechanism for contractors to access, for official purposes, classified general security agreements.

(iii) Industrial security agreements have been negotiated with certain foreign governments that identify the procedures to be used when foreign government classified information is provided to U.S. industry and UUSG classified information is provided to foreign defense industry.

(3) Authorization for disclosure. The GCA will provide disclosure guidance.

(i) Contractors will only disclose non-public USG information to foreign persons in accordance with specified requirements of the contract. In the absence of any specified requirements the contractor will not disclose non-public USG information to foreign persons.

(ii) Disclosure authorization may be in the form of an export license or other export authorization by a cognizant export authority.

(iii) The contractor may not use disclosure guidance provided by the GCA for a previous contract or program unless so instructed in writing by the GCA or the licensing authority.

(iv) Disclosure and export of classified information, authorized by an appropriate USG disclosure official, by a contractor will ensure the following:

(A) International agreements. Contractors may not disclose classified information until agreements are signed by the participating government and disclosure guidance and security arrangements are established. The export of technical data pursuant to such agreements may be exempt by approval of the Department of State or the Department of Commerce.

(B) Symposia, seminars, exhibitions, and conferences. Contractors must assure that any foreign nationals who will be attending a classified gathering have the appropriate export license, disclosure authority, and security assurance on file.

(C) Visits by foreign nationals to the contractor. The contractor will limit disclosure of classified information to that specific information authorized in connection with an approved visit request and an export authorization, as required.

(D) Temporary exports. Classified articles, including articles that require the use of classified information for operation, exported for demonstration purposes must remain under U.S. control. The contractor must obtain an export authorization from the relevant authority (i.e., from the Department of State in accordance with 22 CFR parts 120-130, also known as and referred to in this rule as the “International Traffic in Arms Regulations,” or from the Department of Commerce in accordance with 15 CFR parts 730-774, also known as the “Export Administration Regulations”).

(4) Direct commercial arrangements.

(i) The disclosure of classified information may be authorized pursuant to a direct commercial sale with the appropriate export authorization. A direct commercial arrangement includes sales, loans, leases, or grants of classified items, including sales under a government agency sales financing program.

(ii) If a proposed disclosure is in support of a foreign government requirement, the contractor should consult with U.S. in-country officials, normally the U.S. Security Assistance/Armaments Cooperation Office or Commercial Counselor.

(A) Before a contractor makes a proposal to a foreign interest that involves the eventual disclosure of U.S. classified information, the contractor must obtain appropriate government disclosure authorization.

(B) Such disclosure authorization does not equate with authorization for export. Export authorization must be obtained from the appropriate regulatory body.

(iii) The contractor will request a FCL assurance for a foreign entity through the CSA from the security authority of the foreign entity's sponsoring government prior to entering into a contractual arrangement with the foreign entity.

(5) Subcontract security provisions.

(i) A U.S. contractor may be authorized to enter into an agreement involving classified information with a foreign contractor. The U.S. contractor's empowered official will verify the contractor can release the information to a foreign person. Such agreements may include:

(A) Award of a subcontract.

(B) Department of State authorized manufacturing license agreement, technical assistance agreement, or other direct commercial arrangement.

(ii) The contractor will incorporate security provisions into the subcontract document or agreement, and provide security classification guidance by means of a Contract Security Classification Specification, or equivalent.

(iii) The contractor will provide a copy of the signed contract with the provisions and the classification guidance to the CSA.

(iv) If the export authorization specifies that additional security arrangements are necessary for performance on the contract, the contractor will incorporate those additional arrangements by appropriate provision in the contract or in a separate security document.

(v) The contractor will prepare and maintain a written record that identifies the originator or source of classified information that will be used in providing classified defense articles, material or services to foreign customers. The contractor will maintain this listing with the contractor's record copy of the pertinent export authorization.

Contractors must insert the bracketed contract specific information (e.g., applicable country and disposition of classified material) where noted, when using the following security clauses in the contract.

(A) All classified information and material furnished or generated under the contract will be protected to ensure that:

(1) The recipient will not release the information or material to any third party without disclosure authorization and export authorization, as appropriate.

(2) The recipient will afford the information and material a degree of protection equivalent to that afforded it by the releasing government.

(3) The recipient will not use the information and material for other than the purpose for which it was furnished without the prior written consent of the releasing government.

(B) Classified information and material furnished or generated under this contract will be transferred through government channels or other channels specified in writing by the governments of the United States and [insert applicable country]. It will only be transferred to persons who have an appropriate security clearance and an official need for access to the information in order to perform on the contract.

(C) Classified information and material furnished under the contract will be re-marked by the recipient with its government's equivalent security classification markings.

(D) Classified information and material generated under the contract must be assigned a security classification as specified by the Contract Security Classification Specifications, or equivalent, provided with this contract.

(E) All cases in which it is known or there is reason to believe that classified information or material furnished or generated under the contract has been lost or disclosed to unauthorized persons will be reported promptly and fully by the contractor to its government's security authorities.

(F) Classified information and material furnished or generated pursuant to the contract will not be further provided to another potential contractor or subcontractor unless:

(1) A potential contractor which is located in the United States or [insert applicable country] has been approved for access to classified information and material by the USG or [insert applicable country] security authorities; or

(2) If located in a third country, prior written USG consent is obtained.

(G) Upon completion of the contract, all classified material furnished or generated pursuant to the contract will be [insert whether the material is to be returned or destroyed, or provide other instructions].

(H) The recipient contractor will insert terms that substantially conform to the language of these provisions, including this one, in all subcontracts under this contract that involve access to classified information furnished or generated under this contract.

(c) FGI —

(1) General. The contractor will notify the csa when awarded contracts by a foreign interest that will involve access to classified information. The csa will oversee and ensure implementation of the security requirements of the contract on behalf of the foreign government, including the establishment of channels for the transfer of classified material.

(2) Contract security requirements. The foreign entity that awards a classified contract is responsible for providing appropriate security classification guidance and any security requirements clauses. The contractor will report to the CSA when a foreign entity fails to provide classification guidance.

(3) Marking foreign government classified material. Foreign government classified material will be marked in accordance with § 117.14(l).

(4) Foreign Government RESTRICTED Information and “In Confidence” Information. Foreign government RESTRICTED information and “in confidence” information will be marked in accordance with § 117.14(m).

(5) Marking U.S. documents containing FGI. U.S. documents containing FGI will be marked in accordance with § 117.14(n).

(6) Marking documents prepared for foreign governments. Marking documents prepared for foreign governments will be marked in accordance with § 117.14(o).

(7) Storage and control. Contractors will store foreign government material and control access generally in the same manner as U.S. classified material of an equivalent classification. Contractors will store foreign government material in a manner that will separate it from other material. Separation can be accomplished by establishing distinct files in a storage container or on an information system.

(8) Disclosure and use limitations.

(i) FGI is provided by the foreign government to the United States. The contractor will:

(A) Not disclose FGI to nationals of a third country, or to any other third party, or use it for any purpose other than that for which it was provided without the prior written consent of the originating foreign government.

(B) Submit requests for other uses or further disclosure to the GCA for U.S. contracts, and through the CSA for direct commercial contracts.

(ii) Approval of the request by the foreign government does not eliminate the requirement for the contractor to obtain an export authorization.

(9) Transfer. The contractor will transfer FGI within the United States and its territories using the same channels as specified for U.S. classified information of an equivalent classification, except that contractors cannot use non-cleared express overnight carriers for FGI.

(10) Reproduction. The reproduction of foreign government TOP SECRET or equivalent information requires the written approval of the originating government.

(i) A foreign government or foreign contractor may return classified material to a U.S. contractor for repair, modification, or maintenance.

(ii) The approved methods of return will be specified in either the GCA sales arrangement, the security requirements section of a direct commercial sales arrangement or, in the case of material transferred as freight, in the original TP.

(iii) The contractor, on receipt of notification that classified material is to be received, will notify the applicable CSA.

(5) Use of freight forwarders.

(i) A commercial freight forwarder may be used to arrange for the international transfer of classified material as freight.

(A) The freight forwarder must be under contract to a USG agency, U.S. contractor, or the recipient foreign government.

(B) The contract will describe the specific functions to be performed by the freight forwarder.

(C) The responsibility for security and control of the classified material that is processed by freight forwarders remains with the USG until the freight is transferred to a DGR of the recipient government.

(ii) Only freight forwarders that have a valid determination of eligibility for access to classified information and storage capability for classified material at the appropriate level are eligible to take custody or possession of classified material for delivery as freight to foreign recipients. Freight forwarders that only process unclassified paperwork and make arrangements for the delivery of classified material to foreign recipients do not require an eligibility determination for access to classified information.

(iii) A freight forwarder cannot serve as a DGR.

(6) Hand carrying classified material. To meet contractual requirements, the CSA may authorize contractor employees to hand carry classified material outside the United States. SECRET is the highest level of classified material to be carried and it must be of such size and weight that the courier can retain it in his or her possession at all times.

(i) The CSA will ensure that the contractor has made necessary arrangements with U.S. airport security and customs officials and that security authorities of the receiving government approve the plan. If the transfer is under a contract or a bilateral or multinational government program, the GCA will approve the request in writing. The contractor will notify the CSA of a requirement to hand carry at least 5 working days in advance of the transfer.

(ii) The courier must be a full-time employee of the dispatching or receiving contractor who has been determined eligible and has been granted access to classified information.

(iii) The employing contractor will provide the courier with a courier certificate that is consecutively numbered and valid for one journey only.

§ 117.20 Critical Nuclear Weapon Design Information (CNWDI).
(a) General. This section contains the special requirements for protection of CNDWI. The sensitivity of DoD CNWDI is such that access shall be granted to the absolute minimum number of employees who require it for the accomplishment of assigned responsibilities on a classified contract. Because of the importance of such information, special requirements have been established for its control. DoDI 5210.02, “Access to and Dissemination of Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data” (available at: https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/521002p.pdf?ver=2019-01-14-072742-700) establishes these controls in the DoD.

(b) Briefings. Prior to having access to CNWDI, employees will be briefed on its sensitivity by the FSO or his or her alternate. The FSO will be initially briefed by a USG representative.

(1) The briefing will include:

(i) The definition of CNWDI.

(ii) A reminder of the extreme sensitivity of the information.

(iii) An explanation of the individual's continuing responsibility for properly safeguarding CNWDI and for ensuring that dissemination is strictly limited to other personnel who have been authorized for access and have a need-to-know for the particular information.

(2) The briefing will also be tailored to cover any special local requirements. Upon termination of access to CNWDI, the employee will be given an oral debriefing.

(c) Markings. In addition to any other required markings, CNWDI material will be clearly marked in accordance with DoDI 5210.02. At a minimum, CNWDI documents will show such markings on the cover or first page. Portions of documents that contain CNWDI will be marked with an (N) or (CNWDI) following the classification of the portion; for example, TS (RD)(N) or TS(RD)(CNWDI).

(d) Subcontractors. Contractors will not disclose CNWDI to subcontractors without the prior written approval of the GCA. This approval may be included in a contract security classification specification, or equivalent, other contract-related document, or by separate correspondence.

(e) Transmission outside the facility. Transmission of CNWDI outside the contractor's facility is authorized only to the GCA, or to a subcontractor as described in paragraph (d) of this section. Any other transmission must be approved by the GCA.

(1) Prior to transmission to another cleared facility, the contractor will verify from the CSA that the facility has been authorized access to CNWDI. When CNWDI is transmitted to another facility, the inner wrapping will be addressed to the personal attention of the FSO or his or her alternate, and in addition to any other prescribed markings, the inner wrapping will be marked: “Critical Nuclear Weapon Design Information-DoD Instruction 5210.02 Applies.”

(2) The same marking will be used on the inner wrapping of transmissions addressed to the GCA or other USG.

(f) Records. Contractors will annotate CNWDI access in the CSA-designated database for all employees who have been authorized access to CNWDI.

(g) Nuclear weapon data. Some nuclear weapon data is divided into Sigma categories, the protection of which is prescribed by DOE Order 452.8 (available at: https://www.directives.doe.gov/directives-documents/400-series/0452.8-border/@@images/file). However, certain nuclear weapon data has been re-categorized as CNWDI and is protected as described in this section.

§ 117.21 COMSEC.
(a) General. The procedures in this section pertaining to classified COMSEC information will apply to contractors when the contractor:

(1) Requires the use of COMSEC systems in the performance of a contract.

(2) Is required to install, maintain, or operate COMSEC equipment for the USG.

(3) Is required to accomplish research, development, or production of COMSEC systems, COMSEC equipment, or related COMSEC material.

(b) Instructions. Specific requirements for the management and safeguarding of COMSEC material in industry are established in the COMSEC material control and operating procedures provided to the account manager of each industrial COMSEC account by the agency central office of record (COR) responsible for establishing the account. Such procedures that are above the baseline requirements detailed in the other sections of this rule will be contractually mandated.

(c) Clearance and access requirements.

(1) Before a COMSEC account can be established and a contractor may receive or possess COMSEC material accountable to a COR, individuals occupying the positions of FSO, COMSEC account manager, and alternate COMSEC account manager must have a final PCL appropriate for the material to be held in the account.

(i) COMSEC account managers and alternate COMSEC account managers having access to operational TOP SECRET keying material marked as CRYPTO must have a final TOP SECRET security clearance based upon a current investigation of a scope that meets or exceeds that necessary for the access required.

(ii) This requirement does not apply to contractors using only data transfer devices and seed key.

(2) Before disclosure of COMSEC information to a contractor, GCAs must first verify with the CSA that appropriate COMSEC procedures are in place at the contractor facility. If procedures are not in place, the GCA will provide a written request and justification to the CSA to establish COMSEC procedures and a COMSEC account, if appropriate, at the facility and to conduct the initial COMSEC or cryptographic access briefings for the FSO and COMSEC account personnel.

(3) Access to COMSEC information by a contractor requires a final entity eligibility determination and a USG-issued final PCL at the appropriate level; however, an Interim TOP SECRET entity eligibility determination or PCL is valid for access to COMSEC at the SECRET and CONFIDENTIAL levels.

(4) If a COMSEC account will be required, the Contract Security Classification Specification, or equivalent, will contain a statement regarding the establishment of a COMSEC account as appropriate.

(d) Establishing a COMSEC account.

(1) When COMSEC material that is accountable to a COR is to be provided, acquired, or produced under a contract, the contracting officer will inform the contractor that a COMSEC account must be established. The contractor will forward the names of U.S. citizen employees who will serve as the COMSEC account manager and alternate COMSEC account manager to the CSA. The CSA will forward the names of the FSO, COMSEC account manager, and alternate COMSEC account manager, along with a contractual requirement for the establishment of a COMSEC account (using DD Form 254 or equivalent) to the appropriate COR, with a copy to the GCA, indicating that the persons have been cleared and COMSEC has been briefed.

(2) The COR will then establish the COMSEC account and notify the CSA that the account has been established.

(3) An individual may be appointed as the COMSEC account manager or alternate COMSEC account manager for more than one account only when approved by each COR concerned.

(e) COMSEC briefing and debriefing.

(1) All contractor employees who require access to classified COMSEC information in the performance of their duties will be briefed before access is granted. Depending on the nature of COMSEC access required, either a COMSEC briefing or a cryptographic access briefing will be given. The FSO, the COMSEC account manager, and the alternate COMSEC account manager will be briefed by a USG representative or their designee. Other contractor employees will be briefed by the FSO, the COMSEC account personnel, or other individual designated by the FSO. The purpose of the briefing is to ensure that the contractor understands:

(i) The unique nature of COMSEC information and its unusual sensitivity.

(ii) The special security requirements for the handling and protection of COMSEC information.

(iii) The penalties prescribed in 18 U.S.C. 793, 794, and 798 for disclosure of COMSEC information.

(2) COMSEC debriefings are not required.

(3) The contractor will maintain a record of all COMSEC briefings as specified by the appropriate COR.

(f) U.S. classified cryptographic information access briefing and debriefing requirements.

(1) U.S. classified cryptographic information does not include seed key or controlled cryptographic items.

(2) A contractor's employee may be granted access to U.S. classified cryptographic information only if the employee:

(i) Is a U.S. citizen.

(ii) Has a final USG-issued eligibility determination appropriate to the classification of the U.S. cryptographic information to be accessed.

(iii) Has a valid need-to-know to perform duties for, or on behalf of, the USG.

(iv) Receives a security briefing appropriate to the U.S. Classified Cryptographic Information to be accessed.

(v) Acknowledges the granting of access to classified information by executing Section I of Secretary of Defense (SD) Form 572, “Cryptographic Access Certification and Termination” (available at: https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/forms/sd/sd0572.pdf).

(vi) Where so directed by a USG department or agency head, acknowledges the possibility of being subject to a CI scope polygraph examination that will be administered in accordance with department or agency directives and applicable law.

(3) An employee granted access to cryptographic information will be debriefed and execute Section II of the SD 572 not later than 90 days from the date access is no longer required.

(4) The contractor will maintain the SD 572 for a minimum of five years following the debriefing.

(5) Cryptographic access briefings must fully meet the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.

(g) Destruction and disposition of COMSEC material. The appropriate GCA representative, e.g., the contracting officer representative, will provide directions to the contractor when accountable COMSEC material is to be destroyed. These directions may be provided in superseding editions of publications or by specific instructions.

(h) Subcontracting COMSEC work. Subcontracts requiring the disclosure of classified COMSEC information will be awarded only upon the written approval of the GCA.

(i) Unsolicited proposals. Any unsolicited proposal for a COMSEC system, equipment, development, or study that may be submitted by a contractor to a USG agency will be forwarded to the Deputy National Manager for National Security Systems for review and follow up action at: Deputy National Manager for National Security Systems, NSA, Fort George G. Meade, MD 20755-6000.

§ 117.22 DHS CCIPP.
(a) General. DHS will coordinate with other USG agencies that have an equity with a private sector entity and the CCIPP in accordance with § 117.6(f).

(b) Authority.

(1) The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to determine the eligibility for personnel security clearances and to administer the sharing of relevant classified NSI with certain private sectors or non-federal partners for the purpose of furthering cybersecurity information sharing among critical infrastructure partners pursuant to E.O. 13691.

(2) DHS provides security oversight and assumes security responsibilities similar to those of an FSO, unless otherwise provided in this section. Participating entities will cooperate with DHS security officials to ensure the entity is in compliance with requirements in this rule.

§ 117.23 Supplement to this rule: Security Requirements for Alternative Compensatory Control Measures (ACCM), Special Access Programs (SAPs), Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), Restricted Data (RD), Formerly Restricted Data (FRD), Transclassified Foreign Nuclear Information (TFNI), and Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information (NNPI).
(a) General. Given the sensitive nature of Alternative Compensatory Control Measures (ACCM), SAPs, SCI, RD, FRD, TFNI, and NNPI, the security requirements prescribed in this section exceed baseline standards for this rule and must be applied, as applicable, through specific contract requirements.

(1) Compliance. The contractor will comply with the security measures reflected in this section and other documents specifically referenced, when applied by the GCA or designee as part of a contract. Acceptance of the contract security measures is a prerequisite to any negotiations leading to program participation and an area accreditation (e.g., an SCI facility or SAP facility accreditation).

(2) CSA-imposed higher standards. In some cases, security or sensitive factors of a CSA-created program may require security measures that exceed the standards of this section. In such cases, the CSA-imposed higher standards specifically detailed in the contract or conveyed through other applicable directives will be binding on USG and contractor participants. In cases of doubt over the specific provisions, the contractor should consult the program security officer and the contracting officer before taking any action or expending program-related funds. In cases of extreme emergencies requiring immediate attention, the action taken should protect the USG's interest and the security of the program from loss or compromise.

(3) Waivers. Every effort will be made to avoid waivers to established standards unless they are in the best interest of the USG. In those cases where waivers are deemed necessary, a request will be submitted in accordance with the procedures established by the CSA.

(b) Intelligence information. National intelligence is under the jurisdiction and control of the DNI, who establishes security policy for the protection of national intelligence and intelligence sources, methods, and activities. In addition to the guidance in this rule, contractors will follow Intelligence Community directives, policy guidance, standards, and specifications for the protection of classified national intelligence and SCI.

(c) ACCM. Contractors may participate in ACCMs, or be directed to participate, only when such access and the associated security plan are identified in DD Form 254 or equivalent. Care must be taken to ensure identification of the security plan does not disclose ACCM-protected data.

(1) ACCM contracts. DoD contractors will implement the security requirements for ACCMs, when established by contract, in accordance with applicable statutes, E.O.s, CSA directives, instructions, manuals, regulations, standards, and memorandums.

(2) Non-DoD with ACCMs. Contractors performing on ACCM contracts issued by other than DoD GCAs will implement ACCM protection requirements imposed in their contracts.

(d) SAPs —

(1) DoD SAP contracts. Contractors will implement the security requirements for SAPs codified in SAP-related policy, when established by contract. These documents include, but are not limited to, statutes, E.O.s, CSA directives, instructions, manuals, regulations, standards, memorandums, and other SAP security related policy documents.

(2) Non-DoD SAPs. Contractors performing on SAP contracts issued by non-DoD GCAs will implement SAP protection requirements imposed in their contracts. These requirements may be from, but are not limited to, statutes, E.O.s, CSA directives, instructions, manuals, regulations, standards, memorandums, and other SAP security related policy documents.

(e) RD, FRD, and TFNI —

(1) General. This section describes some of the requirements for nuclear-related information designated RD, FRD, or TFNI in accordance with the AEA and 10 CFR part 1045. 10 CFR part 1045 contains the full requirements for classification and declassification of RD, FRD, and TFNI. Information on safeguarding of RD by access permittees is contained in 10 CFR part 1016. For RD that is NNPI, the additional provisions of paragraph (f) of this section apply.

(i) The DOE is the sole authority for establishing requirements for classifying, accessing, handling, securing, and protecting RD. The DOE and the DoD share authority for the requirements for FRD. The DOE and ODNI share authority for establishing requirements for TFNI.

(ii) RD, FRD, and TFNI categories are distinguished from the NSI category, which is governed in accordance with E.O. 13526.

(A) RD, FRD, and TFNI have unique marking requirements and are not subject to automatic declassification. In addition, RD and FRD have special restrictions regarding foreign release.

(B) It is necessary to differentiate between the handling of this information and NSI because of its direct relationship to our nation's nuclear deterrent.

(iii) Some access requirements for RD and FRD exceed the requirements for NSI. Due to the unique national security implications of RD and FRD, and to facilitate maintaining consistency of codified requirement, they are not repeated in the baseline of this rule, but may be applied through specific contract requirements.

(iv) When RD is transclassified as TFNI, it is safeguarded as NSI. Such information will be labeled as TFNI. The label TFNI will be included on documents to indicate it is exempt from automatic declassification as specified in 10 CFR part 1045, the AEA, E.O. 13526, and 32 CFR part 2001.

(2) Unauthorized disclosures. Contractors will report all unauthorized disclosures involving RD, FRD and TFNI information to the CSA.

(3) International requirements. The AEA provides for a program of international cooperation to promote common defense and security and to make available to cooperating nations the benefits of peaceful applications of atomic energy as widely as expanding technology and considerations of the common defense and security will permit.

(i) Information controlled in accordance with the AEA, RD, and FRD may be shared with another nation only under the terms of an agreement for cooperation. The disclosure by a contractor of RD and FRD will not be permitted until an agreement is signed by the United States and participating governments, and disclosure guidance and security arrangements are established.

(ii) RD and FRD will not be transmitted to a foreign national or regional defense organization unless such action is approved and undertaken under an agreement for cooperation between the United States and the cooperating entity and supporting statutory determinations, as prescribed in the AEA.

(4) Personnel security clearance and access. Only the DOE, the NRC, the DoD, and the National Aeronautics and Space Agency can grant access to RD and FRD that is under their cognizance. Access to RD and FRD must be granted in accordance with the AEA. Baseline requirements for access to RD and FRD are codified in specific DoD, DOE, NRC, and the National Aeronautics and Space Agency directives and regulations. In addition, need-to-know and other restrictions on access apply.

(5) Classification and declassification.

(i) All persons with access to RD and FRD must receive initial and periodic refresher training as required under § 1045.120 10 CFR. The training must include the following information:

(A) What information is potentially RD and FRD.

(B) Matter that potentially contains RD or FRD must be reviewed by an RD derivative classifier to determine whether it is RD or FRD.

(C) The DOE must review matter that potentially contains RD or TFNI for public release and DOE or DoD must review matter that potentially contains FRD for public release.

(D) RD derivative classification authority is required to classify or upgrade matter containing RD or FRD, or to downgrade the level of matter containing RD or FRD.

(E) Only a person trained in accordance with § 1045.120 10 CFR may classify matter containing TFNI.

(F) Matter containing RD, FRD, and TFNI is not automatically declassified and only DOE-authorized persons may downgrade the category or declassify matter marked as containing RD. Only DOE or DoD authorized persons may downgrade the category or declassify matter marked as containing FRD.

(G) How to submit a challenge if they believe RD, FRD, or TFNI information (e.g., a guide topic) or matter containing RD, FRD, or TFNI is not properly classified.

(H) Access requirements for matter marked as containing RD or FRD.

(ii) All persons with access to TFNI must receive initial and periodic refresher training as required under § 1045.120 10 CFR. This training may be combined with the training for access to RD and FRD. The training must include the following information:

(A) What information is potentially TFNI.

(B) Only a person with appropriate training may determine if matter contains TFNI.

(C) Marking requirements for matter containing TFNI.

(D) Matter containing TFNI is not automatically declassified and only DOE authorized persons may downgrade the category or declassify matter marked as containing TFNI.

(E) How to submit a challenge if they believe TFNI information (e.g., a guide topic) or matter containing TFNI is not properly classified.

(iii) Persons with access to RD, FRD, or TFNI must submit matter that potentially contains RD or FRD to an RD derivative classifier for review. If matter potentially contains TFNI, it must be submitted to a person trained to make TFNI determinations. Matter potentially containing RD, FRD, or TFNI must be reviewed, even if the potential RD, FRD, or TFNI is derived from the open literature. Prior to review, the matter must be marked as a working paper under 10 CFR 1045.140(c). If the matter is intended for pubic release and potentially contains RD or TFNI, it must be submitted to the DOE for review. If the matter is intended for public release and contains FRD, it must be submitted to the DOE or the DoD.

(iv) Only RD derivative classifiers may classify matter containing RD or FRD. RD derivative classifiers must receive initial training and refresher training every two years as required under 10 CFR 1045.120. The training must include the content for persons with access to RD and FRD, along with the following:

(A) The use of classification guides, classification bulletins, and portion-marked source documents to classify matter containing RD and FRD.

(B) What to do if applicable classification guidance is not available.

(C) Limitations on an RD derivative classifier's authority to remove RD or FRD portions from matter.

(D) Marking requirements for matter containing RD and FRD.

(v) Only persons with appropriate training may review matter to determine if it contains TFNI. Training must be completed prior to making determinations and every two years after. The training must include the content for persons with access to TFNI and the following:

(A) The markings applied to matter containing TFNI.

(B) Limitations on their authority to remove TFNI portions from matter.

(C) Only DOE authorized persons may determine that classified matter no longer contains TFNI.

(D) Only DOE-authorized persons may declassify matter marked as containing TFNI.

(E) The DOE must review matter that potentially contains TFNI for public release.

(vi) RD derivative classifiers must use approved classification guides, classification bulletins, or portion-marked source documents as the basis for classifying matter containing RD and FRD.

(vii) Persons trained to make TFNI determinations must use approved TFNI guidelines, classification guides, classification bulletins, or portion-marked source documents as the basis for classifying or upgrade matter containing TFNI.

(6) Marking matter containing RD, FRD, and TFNI. The front page of matter containing RD or FRD must have the highest classification level of the information on the top and bottom of the first page, the RD or FRD admonishment, the subject or title marking, and the classification authority block. Matter containing TFNI must include the TFNI identifier on each page unless the matter also contains RD or FRD, in which case the RD or FRD takes precedence.

(i) Documents classified as RD or FRD must also include a Classification Authority Block with the RD derivative classifier's name and position, title, or unique identifier and the classification guide or source document (by title and date) used to classify the document. No declassification date or event may be placed on a document containing RD, FRD, or TFNI. If a document containing RD, FRD, or TFNI also contains NSI, “N/A to RD/FRD/TFNI” (as appropriate) must be placed on the “Declassify On:” line.

(ii) Each interior page of matter containing RD or FRD must be clearly marked at the top and bottom with the overall classification level and category of the matter or the overall classification level and category of the page, whichever is preferred. The abbreviations “RD” or “FRD” may be used in conjunction with the matter classification (e.g., SECRET//RD, CONFIDENTIAL//FRD).

Table 1 to Paragraph (e)(6)(ii) RD and FRD Admonishment Markings

Document
containing	Admonishment that must be included on the
front page of the document
RD	“RESTRICTED DATA
This document contains RESTRICTED DATA as defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Unauthorized disclosure is subject to administrative and criminal sanctions.”
FRD	“FORMERLY RESTRICTED DATA
Unauthorized disclosure subject to administrative and criminal sanctions. Handle as Restricted Data in foreign dissemination. Section 144b, AEA 1954.”
(iii) Documents classified as RD or FRD must also include a Classification Authority Block with the RD derivative classifier's name and position, title, or unique identifier and the classification guide or source document (by title and date) used to classify the document.

(iv) Other than the required subject or title markings, portion marking is permitted, but not required, for matter containing RD or FRD. Each agency that generates matter containing RD or FRD determines the policy for portion-marking matter generated within the agency. If matter containing RD or FRD is portion-marked, each portion containing RD or FRD must be marked with the level and category of the information in the portion (e.g., SRD, CFRD, S//RD, C//FRD).

(v) Additional information and requirements are in 10 CFR 1045.140. Requests for additional information about the classification and declassification of RD, FRD, and TFNI can be directed to Agency RD Management Officials or the DOE Office of Classification at outreach@hq.doe.gov or at (301) 903-7567.

(7) Declassification.

(i) No date or event for automatic declassification ever applies to RD, FRD, or TFNI documents, even if they contain classified NSI. RD, FRD, or TFNI documents remain classified until a positive action by a designated DOE official (for RD, FRD, or TFNI) or an appropriate DoD official (for FRD) is taken to declassify them.

(ii) RD derivative classifiers may remove RD or FRD from portion-marked source matter if the resulting matter is not for public release. RD derivative classifiers cannot declassify matter marked as containing RD, FRD, and TFNI. Matter that potentially contains RD or TFNI must be sent to designated individuals in the DOE and those containing FRD must be sent to designated individuals in the DoD for declassification or removal of the RD, FRD, or TFNI prior to public release.

(iii) Matter containing TFNI is excluded from the automatic declassification provisions of E.O. 13526 until the TFNI designation is properly removed by the DOE. When the DOE determines that a TFNI designation may be removed, any remaining classified information must be referred to the appropriate agency.

(iv) Any matter marked as or that potentially contains RD, FRD, or TFNI within a document intended for public release that contains RD or FRD subject area indicators must be reviewed by the appropriate DOE organization.

(8) Challenges to RD, FRD, and TFNI. A contractor employee who believes RD, FRD, or TFNI is classified improperly or unnecessarily may challenge that classification following the procedures established by the GCA. They may also send challenges directly to the Director, Office of Classification, AU-60/Germantown Building; U.S. Department of Energy; 1000 Independence Avenue SW, Washington, DC 20585, at any time. Under no circumstance is an employee subject to retribution for challenging the classification status of RD, FRD, or TFNI.

(9) Commingling. Commingling of RD, FRD, and TFNI with NSI in the same document should be avoided to the greatest degree possible. When mixing this information cannot be avoided, the marking requirements in 10 CFR part 1045, section 140(f) and declassification requirements of 10 CFR part 1045, section 155 apply.

(10) Protection of RD and FRD. Most of the protection requirements for RD and FRD are similar to NSI and are based on the classification level. However, there are some protection requirements for certain RD information that may be applied through specific contract requirements by the GCA. These range from distribution limitations through the limitation of access to specifically authorized individuals to specific storage requirements, including the requirement for IDSs, and additional accountability records.

(i) Any DOE contractor that violates a classified information security requirement may be subject to a civil penalty under the provisions of 10 CFR part 824.

(ii) Certification is required for individuals authorized access to specific Sigma categories, as appropriate. Address questions regarding these requirements to DOE's National Nuclear Security Administration, Office of Defense Programs.

(iii) Storage and distribution requirements are determined by the classification level, category, and Sigma category. Sigma designation is not a requirement for all RD documents. Storage and distribution requirements will be dependent only on classification level and category.

(11) Accountability. In addition to TOP SECRET information, some SECRET RD information is considered accountable (e.g., specific Sigma 14 matter). Each nuclear weapon data control point will keep a record of transactions involving Secret nuclear weapon data documents under its jurisdiction including origination, receipt, transmission, current custodian, reproduction, change of classification, declassification, and destruction.

(12) Cybersecurity. Classified databases, systems, and networks containing RD and FRD are protected under the requirements developed and distributed by the DOE Office of the Chief Information Officer.
