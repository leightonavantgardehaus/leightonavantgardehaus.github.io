# Leighton Dynamica 2026 Compliance

### Defense Compliance Summary for Leighton Dynamica

Leighton Dynamica, operating through Leighton Avant-Garde Haus and subsidiaries like Xerataus IQX, is committed to delivering innovative AI and technology solutions exclusively for government use, with a focus on defense applications. As a small, agile entity, we prioritize compliance with U.S. Department of War (DoW) regulations to ensure secure, ethical, and reliable services. Our compliance framework is designed to support Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) requirements, enabling us to handle Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and position for classified contracts.

We are actively pursuing opportunities as a defense contractor, with self-attested readiness for CMMC Level 2 as of December 2025. Below is a high-level overview of our compliance posture. Detailed documentation, including System Security Plans (SSP) and Plans of Action & Milestones (POA&M), is available under NDA for qualified partners, primes, or government contracting officers.

## Key Compliance Commitments

* **Cybersecurity and CUI Safeguarding**: Implemented NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2 controls (110/110 addressed or on 180-day POA&M, per current DoW Class Deviation). This includes access controls, system monitoring, and incident response plans with 72-hour reporting to the DoD Cyber Crime Center (DC3) as required by DFARS 252.204-7012. Rev. 3 gap analysis complete for future transition.
* **CMMC Readiness**: Self-attested at Level 2 in the Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS), making us eligible for CUI-handling contracts under CMMC 2.0 Phase 1 (effective November 2025). Preparing for Phase 2 (November 2026) with third-party certification by a Certified Third-Party Assessment Organization (C3PAO).
* **AI Risk Management**: Aligned with the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) 1.0 and the Artificial Intelligence Strategy for the Department of War (January 9, 2026), emphasizing objectively truthful AI, rapid deployment, and no ideological tuning. Our AI development lifecycle incorporates assessments for bias, reliability, explainability, and human oversight, ensuring trustworthy systems for defense applications.
* **Export Controls**: Compliant with U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) for technology, software, and data exports. End-user certificates required for ITAR-controlled items.
* **Supply Chain Security**: Rigorous supplier screening to prevent counterfeit parts, with transparency and flow-down requirements per DFARS 252.246-7007 and NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2.
* **Small Business Utilization**: As a small disadvantaged business, we prioritize subcontracting with other small entities in line with FAR Part 19.
* **Anti-Corruption and Ethics**: Adherence to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), prohibiting bribery and ensuring ethical practices in all operations.
* **Incident Response and Reporting**: Established plans for rapid detection and response, including coordination with DoW channels.
* **Classified Information Handling Aspirations**: Positioned for Facility Security Clearance (FCL) under the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM, 32 CFR Part 117). We seek sponsorship via DD Form 254 for contracts involving classified data, with personnel ready for clearances.

You are solely responsible for the development, content, operation, maintenance, and use of your Content and Customer Data.

# AI Risk Management

In accordance with the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and DoD AI Ethical Principles, we implement measures to manage risks associated with AI systems, including Xerataus IQX and A1MX. These include:
- Validity and Reliability: AI models are tested for accuracy and performance, but Outputs may contain errors or hallucinations. Users must verify Outputs for critical applications.
- Safety and Security: We employ safeguards such as encryption, access controls, and regular audits to prevent unauthorized access or data leaks. Users agree not to input sensitive data without prior review.
- Transparency and Explainability: We provide information on how AI models function where feasible. Outputs include disclaimers on probabilistic nature.
- Fairness and Non-Discrimination: Models are monitored for bias; users must not use AI in ways that perpetuate discrimination (e.g., based on race, gender, or other protected characteristics).
- Privacy: Data processing minimizes collection and uses anonymization where possible.
- Human Oversight and Accountability: High-risk uses require human review. We maintain accountability through incident reporting and audits.
- Environmental Impact: We optimize resource use to reduce the carbon footprint of AI training and inference.
Users acknowledge these risks and agree to use Xerataus IQX responsibly. For high-risk activities, implement human oversight and comply with applicable laws.
