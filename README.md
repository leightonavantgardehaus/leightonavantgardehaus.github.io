# Leighton Dynamica 2026 Compliance

## Defense Compliancy for Leighton Dynamica

Leighton Dynamica, operating through Leighton Avant-Garde Haus and subsidiaries like Xerataus IQX, is committed to delivering innovative AI and technology solutions exclusively for government use, with a focus on defense applications. As a small, agile entity, we prioritize compliance with U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) regulations to ensure secure, ethical, and reliable services. Our compliance framework is designed to support Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) requirements, enabling us to handle Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and position for classified contracts.

We are actively pursuing opportunities as a defense contractor, with self-attested readiness for CMMC Level 2 as of December 2025. Below is a high-level overview of our compliance posture. Detailed documentation, including System Security Plans (SSP) and Plans of Action & Milestones (POA&M), is available under NDA for qualified partners, primes, or government contracting officers.

## Key Compliance Commitments
- Cybersecurity and CUI Safeguarding: Implemented NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 3 controls (97/97 addressed or on 180-day POA&M). This includes access controls, system monitoring, and incident response plans with 72-hour reporting to the DoD Cyber Crime Center (DC3) as required by DFARS 252.204-7012.
- CMMC Readiness: Self-attested at Level 2 in the Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS), making us eligible for CUI-handling contracts under CMMC 2.0 Phase 1 (effective November 2025). We are preparing for third-party certification by a Certified Third-Party Assessment Organization (C3PAO).
- AI Risk Management: Aligned with the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) 1.0 and DoD Ethical Principles for Artificial Intelligence. Our AI development lifecycle incorporates assessments for bias, reliability, explainability, and human oversight, ensuring trustworthy systems for defense applications.
- Export Controls: Compliant with U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) for technology, software, and data exports.
- Supply Chain Security: Rigorous supplier screening to prevent counterfeit parts, with transparency and flow-down requirements per DFARS 252.246-7007 and NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 3.
- Small Business Utilization: As a small disadvantaged business, we prioritize subcontracting with other small entities in line with FAR Part 19.
- Anti-Corruption and Ethics: Adherence to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), prohibiting bribery and ensuring ethical practices in all operations.
- Incident Response and Reporting: Established plans for rapid detection and response, including coordination with DoD channels.
- Classified Information Handling Aspirations: Positioned for Facility Security Clearance (FCL) under the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM, 32 CFR Part 117). We seek sponsorship via DD Form 254 for contracts involving classified data, with personnel ready for clearances.

# AI Risk Management
In accordance with the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and DoD AI Ethical Principles, we implement measures to manage risks associated with AI systems, including Xerataus IQX and A1MX. These include:
	•	Validity and Reliability: AI models are tested for accuracy and performance, but Outputs may contain errors or hallucinations. Users must verify Outputs for critical applications.
	•	Safety and Security: We employ safeguards such as encryption, access controls, and regular audits to prevent unauthorized access or data leaks. Users agree not to input sensitive data without prior review.
	•	Transparency and Explainability: We provide information on how AI models function where feasible. Outputs include disclaimers on probabilistic nature.
	•	Fairness and Non-Discrimination: Models are monitored for bias; users must not use AI in ways that perpetuate discrimination (e.g., based on race, gender, or other protected characteristics).
	•	Privacy: Data processing minimizes collection and uses anonymization where possible.
	•	Human Oversight and Accountability: High-risk uses require human review. We maintain accountability through incident reporting and audits.
	•	Environmental Impact: We optimize resource use to reduce the carbon footprint of AI training and inference.
Users acknowledge these risks and agree to use Xerataus IQX responsibly. For high-risk activities, implement human oversight and comply with applicable laws.

# Ethical AI Use
We adhere to ethical principles including those from the U.S. Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy AI and DoD Responsible AI Strategy. Prohibited uses include:
	•	Developing AI for weapons, unlawful surveillance, or discriminatory purposes.
	•	Generating content promoting violence, disinformation, or illegal activities.

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials available on the Sites infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send Leighton Avant-Garde Haus a notice requesting that we remove the material or block access to it. If you believe in good faith that someone has wrongly filed a notice of copyright infringement against you, you may send a counter-notice to Leighton Avant-Garde Haus under applicable provisions of the DMCA. Please note that substantial penalties under U.S. copyright law may be levied against any filer of a false counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA. See 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3), available at http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html for details. Notices and counter-notices should be sent to:
Attn: Legal Department/DMCA Copyright Agent
Leighton Avant-Garde Haus, L.AgH, LLC including Portfolio Holdings, and Registered Subsidiary Majority Holdings
contact@leightondynamica.cloud
You should note that if you knowingly misrepresent in your notification that the material or activity is infringing, you will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by us or the alleged infringer as the result of our relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing. We encourage you to consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice.
In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, Leighton Avant-Garde Haus may at our discretion limit access to the Sites and/or terminate the accounts of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.

# 13. GENERAL
The Terms and the relationship between each user and Leighton Avant-Garde Haus shall be governed by the laws of the State of North Carolina without regard to its conflict of law provisions and each party shall submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Charlotte, North Carolina. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Except to the extent a Services Agreement applies, these Terms, along with the Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and Leighton Avant-Garde Haus with respect to your use of the Sites and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between you and Leighton Avant-Garde Haus with respect to the Sites. If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect. A party may only waive its rights under these Terms by a written document executed by both parties. Leighton Avant-Garde Haus’ failure to insist on or enforce strict performance of these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver by Leighton Avant-Garde Haus of any provision or any right it has to enforce these Terms, nor shall any course of conduct between Leighton Avant-Garde Haus and you or any other party be deemed to modify any provision of these Terms. The headings of the sections of these Terms are for convenience of reference only and are not intended to restrict, affect or be of any weight in the interpretation or construction of the provisions of such sections.
None of your rights or duties under these Terms may be transferred, assigned or delegated by you without our prior written consent, and any attempted transfer, assignment or delegation without such consent will be void and without effect. We may freely transfer, assign or delegate any of our rights or duties under these Terms. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective representatives, heirs, administrators, successors and permitted assigns. No provision of these Terms is intended for the benefit of any third party, and the parties do not intend that any provision should be enforceable by a third party. Our relationship is an independent contractor relationship, and neither these Terms nor any actions by either party may be interpreted as creating an agency or partnership relationship. Nothing in these Terms shall be construed to obligate Leighton Avant-Garde Haus to enter into or engage with you on any commercial transaction.
If you are provided access to any Software, you acknowledge that such Software may be subject to regulation by local laws and United States government agencies which prohibit export or diversion of certain products or information about products to certain countries and certain persons. You represent and warrant that you will not export or re-export such Software in violation of these regulations.
You acknowledge that your breach of any of the provisions of these Terms may cause immediate and irreparable harm to Leighton Avant-Garde Haus for which we may not have an adequate remedy in money damages. We will therefore be entitled to obtain an injunction against such breach from any court of competent jurisdiction immediately upon request and will be entitled to recover from you the costs incurred in seeking such an injunction. The availability or exercise of our right to obtain injunctive relief will not limit our right to seek or obtain any other remedy.
You agree that we will not be liable for delays, failures, or inadequate performance of the Sites resulting from conditions outside of our reasonable control, including but not limited to natural disasters or other acts of God, failure of telecommunications networks or any other network or utility, threatened or actual acts of terrorism or war, riots, labor strikes, or governmental acts or orders.
Severability
If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.
