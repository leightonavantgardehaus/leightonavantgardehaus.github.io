The NP2 is the secure portal which allows authorized users to receive email, review and download documents, and access information on DCSA products and services to include billing invoice files. The NP2 portal also acts as a gateway to DCSA’s automated systems (PIPS and CVS).

Designated agency NP2 administrators may register individuals in NP2. NP2 requires a PIV/CAC Card or 2-Factor authentication to access the system. The PIV or CAC Card must be registered to gain access to DCSA systems. If assistance logging into the system is needed, the NP2 Support Center should be contacted at dcsa.quantico.hq.mbx.knowledge-center@mail.mil or at 888-282-7682, (option 2, then option 4) between 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. EST.

At this time, Facility Security Officers (FSO) are not eligible to gain access to NP2. Facility Security Officers should contact Adjudication and Vetting Services (AVS) at dcsa.ncr.dcsa-dvd.mbx.askvroc@mail.mil for assistance. All Personally Identifiable Information (PII) should be password protected and AVS will process requests on the FSOs behalf.
